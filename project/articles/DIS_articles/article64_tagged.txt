Ex Gay Addresses Disney Board of Directors
Questions Gay Lobby for Rejecting Equality for Ex Gays
 /PRNewswire USNewswire/  of Parents and Friends of Ex Gays & Gays PFOX addressed the corporate directors of the Walt Disney Company at its annual shareholders meeting and asked them to<b><font color='lime'> approve a resolution</font></b> to include ex gays in Disney's mandatory diversity training for employees.&#160;
"Disney's diversity training emphasizes gays, bisexuals, and transgenders, but<b><font color='red'> fails to include ex gays</font></b>," explained Quinlan.&#160;"Ex gays remain closeted because they are not protected by diversity policies.&#160;Employees who support the ex gay community are also not welcome to express their views."
In response to the resolution asking for inclusion and diversity for the ex gay community, , director of the workplace project at the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, was quoted by Daily Finance as saying that the resolution is "wrongheaded." &#160;The Human Rights Campaign HRC is the nation's largest gay rights organization.&#160;
"How can HRC demand gay equality when it refuses to extend equality to others?" asked Quinlan.&#160;"HRC demands that gays and transgenders be included in diversity policies, but belittles ex gays who ask for the same rights that gays and transgenders enjoy.&#160;HRC says men can change their gender to become women, but refuses to acknowledge that men like me can change our sexual orientation from gay to straight." &#160;
Every year the HRC Foundation issues a Corporate Equality Index which rates companies on their equal treatment of gays and transgenders.&#160;HRC gave Disney a 100 rating, its highest score.&#160;HRC rated Disney on its nondiscrimination policy, diversity training,<b><font color='green'> benefits</font></b>, gay advertising, sponsoring gay events, and not<b><font color='red'> undermining gay</font></b> and transgender equality."Is it a conflict of interest for any corporation to donate money to HRC, which then rates those same corporations on corporate equality?" asked Quinlan."Disney's equality index score is 0 for ex gays and their supporters.&#160;Disney should treat former homosexuals with the same respect and<b><font color='green'> benefits</font></b> its gives to homosexuals."
"Last week HRC celebrated the first gay marriages in , our nation's capital.&#160;But there is one victory HRC did not celebrate.&#160;And that's the DC Superior Court's ruling that ex gays are a legally protected class under the D.C. Human Rights Act."
"PFOX calls on HRC to issue public statements condemning hatred and discrimination against the ex gay community.&#160;Human rights demand no less." &#160; &#160;
