</br>

</br>
 Adds other films, details  |  LOS ANGELES, March 21 Reuters Disney 3 D adventure
</br>
"Alice in Wonderland" retained the top spot at North American
</br>
box offices for a third straight week, collecting $34.5 million
</br>
and beating three new films including romantic comedy "The
</br>
Bounty Hunter."
</br>
 "Diary of a Wimpy Kid," based on the first book in the
</br>
popular series by Jeff Kinney, claimed the No.2 spot with
</br>
$21.8 million as children and parents turned out in solid
</br>
numbers and pushed adult oriented "Bounty Hunter" to third with
</br>
$21 million, according to studio estimates on Sunday.Chris Aronson, senior vice president of domestic
</br>
distribution for "Wimpy Kid" studio 20th Century Fox, said
</br>
audiences were roughly evenly split between males and females
</br>
and more than 40 percent were over age 25, hinting that the
</br>
books' adult fans turned out in theaters, too."It's clearly a family movie, but the audience has been
</br>
broader than that," he said."I think we just found out how
</br>
deep the fan base is and how dear this series is," he said.The books, four so far with a fifth due on bookshelves this
</br>
year, trace the life of U.S. middle school student Gregory
</br>
Heffley and the funny things that happen to him in his daily
</br>
routine of classes, chores, friends, rivals and family."Bounty Hunter" touted major starpower with Gerard Butler
</br>
portraying a career criminal chaser whose new target is his
</br>
ex wife, portrayed by Jennifer Aniston, and it was widely
</br>
promoted heading into the weekend.Both "Wimpy Kid" and "Bounty Hunter" opened in just under
</br>
3,100 theaters, with the former earning about $7,100 per
</br>
location and the latter at just over $6,800 per venue.By contrast, Disney's "Alice" was playing in around 3,700
</br>
locations and pulled in roughly $9,300 per theater, pushing its
</br>
total domestic box office in three weeks to over $265 million.The Disney studio is a unit of Walt Disney Co  , and
</br>
Fox is a division of News Corp  ."Bounty Hunter" was
</br>
released by Columbia Pictures, a part of Sony Corp.The weekend's other new movie, science fiction adventure
</br>
"Repo Men" was a distant fourth with $6.2 million in another
</br>
disappointing opening for Universal Pictures, which last week
</br>
debuted Iraq war film "Green Zone" at No.2 behind "Alice."
</br>
 "Green Zone," starring Matt Damon, fell to No.6 this
</br>
weekend with ticket sales just under $6 million, giving the
</br>
big budget action flick a total of $24.7 million.Universal is
</br>
a unit of the NBC Universal media wing of General Electric Co
</br>
  It was narrowly beat to the No.5 spot by Paramount
</br>
Pictures' comedy "She's Out of My League," which claimed just
</br>
over $6 million.Paramount is a unit of Viacom Inc.Elsewhere, director Roman Polanski's thriller "The Ghost
</br>
Writer" continues to play well in a limited release in major
</br>
cities, earning about $2 million over the weekend, or $14,000
</br>
per theater in only 145 locations.Widely promoted "The Runaways," starring Kristen Stewart
</br>
and Dakota Fanning in the tale of an all girl band, mustered
</br>
$3,300 in 244 theaters for an unspectacular total of $804,000."The Runaways" was released by privately held Apparition
</br>
Films and "Ghost Writer" by closely held Summit Entertainment.Reporting by US SMALL/MIDCAPS Earnings, materials sector lift stocks
