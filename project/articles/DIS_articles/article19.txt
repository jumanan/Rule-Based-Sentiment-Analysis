Disney announces iPad applications
Thu Apr 1, 2010 6:14pm EDT
(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co on Thursday said it will offer applications from all of its businesses on Apple Inc's new iPad electronic tablet, offering popular TV shows, video games and interactive books.
Disney unveiled its applications two days before the iPad goes on sale. It said one new application will extend its ABC.com's full episode player onto the iPad, enabling iPad users to watch ad-supported episodes from 20 popular ABC series through a wi-fi connection.
The application will also allow iPad users to purchase downloads of episodes via the iTunes store.
Disney Publishing Worldwide has built two original "Toy Story" read-along applications for the iPad, featuring video from the feature films, karaoke, voice record features and a feature that lets kids finger-paint on the screen.
The "Toy Story" app is free and the "Toy Story 2" application is $8.99 and comes with a one month free subscription to disneydigitalbooks.com. In addition, "Disney Princess," "Phineas & Ferb," "Winnie the Pooh" and "Toy Story 3" applications will go live on the iPad this spring.
