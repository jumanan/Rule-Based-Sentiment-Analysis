Eclectic Picks Pay Off For Pabrai in Q1 HNR, CSE, BPO, POT, FRFHF, ATSG, IBKR, WFC, TCK, TEX, BRK.A, BRK.B Hedge Fund and Institutional News
After returning investors between 118% and 125% during 2009, value guru and Warren Buffett disciple Mohnish Pabrai was trimming stakes in some of his largest equity holdings towards the end of the year.With some of his top bets from the end of Q4 gaining more than 25% so far in 2010, we&#8217;ll be watching closely when his hedge fund&#8217;s holdings at today&#8217;s close are reported in a month and a half.Assuming Pabrai maintained his  NYSE: BRK.A, BRK.B stake through yesterday&#8217;s close, he has watched shares jump by nearly 25%, and that was barely enough to crack into the top third of Pabrai Funds&#8217; top 15 U.S. listed equity holdings
 from the end of 2009 by performance during the first quarter.Oil and natural gas player Harvest Natural Resources
 and commercial lender  both added over 40% for the period, while Brookfield Properties
 jumped by nearly 30%.and Canadian insurance firm Fairfax Financial Holdings
 OTC: FRFHF , where Pabrai was adding stakes during Q4, had mixed returns during the early portion of 2010.Potash added 10.8% leading to yesterday&#8217;s close while Fairfax sank by 6.2%.Meanwhile, Air Transport Services Group
Interactive Brokers Group
 were also among laggards from Pabrai&#8217;s end of 2009 portfolio.Other winners among Pabrai&#8217;s top bets heading into 2010 include Buffett holding  , diversified miner  , and construction machine company  .All three added more than 10% into yesterday&#8217;s close.Barring a major sell off during the last session of the first quarter, Pabrai&#8217;s top picks largely outperformed the market for the period, and it will be interesting to see where he was mixing things up when the next batch of filings are due in mid May.In the meantime, investors can visit tickerspy.com to see all of Pabrai&#8217;s top holdings from the end of 2009 and a chart of their combined performance
