Intel (INTC) Showing Support at 22.13 With a 2.8% Dividend Yield
Posted: Tuesday, March 30, 2010 9:19 AM EDT 
Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) closed yesterday at $22.33. So far the stock has hit a 52-week low of $14.48 and 52-week high of $22.75. Intel stock has been showing support around 22.13 and resistance in the 22.59 range. Technical indicators for the stock are Bullish and S&P gives INTC a positive 4 STAR (out of 5) buy rating. INTC appears on the Investors Observer Analysts Favorites list. For a hedged play on this stock, look at a Jul '10 22 covered call for a net debit in the $20.99 area. That is also the break even stock price for this trade. This covered call has a 109 day duration, provides 6.00% downside protection and a 4.81% assigned return rate for a 16.11% annualized return rate (comparison purposes only). A lower cost hedged play for this stock would use a longer term call option in place of the covered call stock purchase. To use this strategy look at going long the INTC Jan '11 17.50 Call and selling the Jul '10 22 call for a $3.91 debit. The trade has a 109 day life and would provide 4.12% downside protection and a 15.09% assigned return rate for a 51.00% annualized return rate (for comparison purposes only). Intel has a current annual dividend yield of 2.82%. [ATU-Seven Summits Research]
