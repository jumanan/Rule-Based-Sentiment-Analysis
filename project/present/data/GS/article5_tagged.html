Citi Cuts EPS View on Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley
</br>
Investment banking giants Goldman Sachs  and Morgan Stanley  headed south in the premarkets Tuesday morning in the wake of a negative note from Citigroup analysts.Citi cut its EPS view on both banks to reflect slower than expected investment banking activity and more muted equity trading volumes.January "was a strong start to the year for equity trading, however February client activity was weak across the Street, and the March rally only provided partial rebound, so we expect 1Q will show smaller than normal seasonal benefit for equity trading/commissions," Citi wrote in a note.Citi lowered its first quarter EPS view by 10 cents, to $4.45, on Goldman.The analysts kept their full year EPS forecast of $18, "buy" rating and $240 price target on the stock.Citi cut its first quarter EPS forecast on Morgan Stanley by 14 cents to 58 cents, and its 2010 view by 50 cents to $2.50.Citi kept its “hold” rating and $32 price target on Morgan.Shares of Goldman<b><font color='red'> fell 0.4 %</font></b> to $172.55 ahead of Tuesday’s open.Morgan’s stock slid 0.7% to $29.10 in the premarkets.In contrast to the Citi note, Wells Fargo upgraded large cap U.S. banks to “market weight” on improving economic conditions and said Bank of America  are best positioned, Reuters reported.Personal Finance Investing Financial News Business News Stock Market Quotes & News Small Business
