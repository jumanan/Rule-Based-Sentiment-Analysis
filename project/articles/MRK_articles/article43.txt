Dow rises on Merck and Pfizer
The Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered from a lower opening to trade positive for the day.
Pharmaceutical giants Merck (NYSE:MRK) and 
 (NYSE:PFE) are among its steepest gainers.
The Dow is up 28.19 points, or 0.26 percent, to trade at 10,770.17 at 12:21 p.m. EST. The S&P; 500 Index gained 2.91 points, or 0.25 percent, to trade at 1,162.81.
Merck is currently trading up 1.55 percent and 
Other top performing components of the Dow include American Express (NYSE:AXP), up 1.77 percent, and Boeing (NYSE:BA), which is up 2.15 percent to trade at $72.24 after Oppenheimer upgraded the firm to "outperform" with a price target of $80. 
The House of Representatives passed the Senate version of the health care reform bill on Sunday with a 219-212 vote.
The depressed shares of the health care industry generally rallied as the bill largely removes the regulatory uncertainty in this industry. In addition, the bill may also contain benefits for pharmaceuticals.
The bill would expand coverage to approximately 32 million Americans, increasing the market for drug makers.
Legislation addressing the "doughnut hole," or the gap in Medicare coverage between the initial limit and the catastrophic threshold, is not overly punitive.
When seniors hit the doughnut hole, pharmaceuticals will only be required to give a 50 percent discount.
Lastly it was reported last Thursday that the bill would not include a ban on "pay-for-delay" settlements, in which pharmaceuticals pay generic drug makers to delay entering the market with cheap substitutes.
