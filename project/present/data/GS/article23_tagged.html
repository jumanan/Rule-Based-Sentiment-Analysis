 March 26 Bloomberg New York.London.Warsaw?The Polish capital is luring international investment banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the world&rsquo;<b><font color='green'> s most profitable</font></b>, as the government prepares record share offerings this year.Goldman, based in New York, is seeking to open a branch office in Warsaw, spokeswoman Monika Schaller said yesterday.Credit Suisse Group AG of Zurich announced in January a plan to open a brokerage this year after shuttering its Warsaw stock dealing business in 2003.&ldquo;The government has a very ambitious plan to make Warsaw a financial hub for the region and expects foreign banks to establish a local presence,&rdquo; Marek Gul, who heads Credit Suisse&rsquo;s business in Warsaw, said in an interview.&ldquo;Investment banks that aren&rsquo;t yet here want to get in.&rdquo;
</br>
 The main lure is advisory work for the Polish government, which plans to sell stakes this year in its energy, insurance, chemical and phone companies to raise $10 billion to finance the widening budget deficit.The economy, the only one in the European Union to avoid a recession, and the Warsaw Stock Exchange, where the total value of listed companies has tripled since 2003, are also attractive, bankers said.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no wonder foreign banks are coming to Poland,&rdquo; said Kazimierz Szpak, who helps manage the equivalent of $1.6 billion at KBC TFI SA, a Warsaw based mutual fund.&ldquo;The Treasury is selling stakes, boosting the free float of many stocks, and generally, turnover is on the rise.This has been noticed.&rdquo;
</br>
 Poland&rsquo;s benchmark WIG20 stock index was little changed at 2,496.66 at 3:20 p.m. in Warsaw, bringing this year&rsquo;s gain to 4.4 percent.The measure surged 33 percent in 2009.&lsquo;Iconic Brand&rsquo;
</br>
 Goldman &ldquo;is an iconic brand, and the information that they want to establish their office in Warsaw is a very important signal for the world,&rdquo; Ludwik Sobolewski, head of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, said in an interview today.Credit Suisse, Goldman and New York based JPMorgan Chase & Co. are among international banks vying with local firms for underwriting and advisory work even though fees in Poland are typically lower than those in western Europe and the U.S.The government agreed to pay 0.8 percent to bookrunners including Credit Suisse, Citigroup Inc. and UniCredit SpA this year on the sale of a 16 percent stake in Enea, the nation&rsquo;s third biggest power utility, according to a statement.The banks can also earn a 0.3 percent bonus.That compares with average fees of 3.8 percent on equity offerings in the U.S. this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Lower Fees
</br>
 Deutsche Bank AG, UniCredit and Bank of America Merrill Lynch charged a combined 0.5 percent in fees for managing a 5.13 billion zloty $1.76 billion rights offering of PKO SA, Poland&rsquo;s largest bank, in October, according to a regulatory filing.In Europe, fees for rights offers ranged from about 2 percent to as high as 3.25 percent for HSBC Holdings Plc&rsquo;s $18.3 billion sale in March.Poland&rsquo;s government is urging banks to set up shop in Warsaw if they want business from the state.&ldquo;When picking banks to advise us on privatization deals, we consider their commitment to the market,&rdquo; said Maciej Wewior, a spokesman for the Treasury Ministry.The government plans this year to sell an additional 10 percent of PGE SA, the country&rsquo;s biggest power producer.PZU SA, the state owned insurer, may sell 5 billion zloty of shares in an IPO next month, and the government also plans to sell more than 25 percent in utility Tauron Polska Energia SA in the first half of the year.The Warsaw bourse may also go public after the state dropped plans to sell the market operator to a competitor last year, according to the government.Asset Sales
</br>
 JPMorgan, which has offices in Warsaw and Moscow, was hired last month to lead the sale of the government&rsquo;s 32 percent stake in Mennica Polska SA, the sole supplier of coins to the country&rsquo;s central bank.JPMorgan intends to take part in most of the tenders for managing asset sales, including PGE, said Cezary Stypulkowski, head of operations in central Europe.&ldquo;Our ambition is to be present in the new privatization pipeline in Poland,&rdquo; Stypulkowski said in an interview in Warsaw last month.&ldquo;It is imperative to have a strong presence here.&rdquo;
</br>
 Goldman Sachs applied to the U.K. Financial Services Authority to open a Warsaw branch, its eighth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Anna Krajewska, a spokeswoman at NBS Public Relations in the Polish capital, said by phone.&ldquo;The strength and size of the economy is what makes the market attractive,&rdquo; Schaller, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt, said by phone yesterday.She declined to say how many employees the bank plans to have in Warsaw.Hiring Brokers
</br>
 Credit Suisse has an empty trading floor in the center of the Polish capital and plans to fill it by June, said Gul, who also declined to elaborate on the bank&rsquo;s hiring plan.Raiffeisen International Bank Holding AG, the Austrian lender that operates in 17 eastern European countries, also plans to reopen a brokerage, said Marcin Jedlinski, a spokesman in Warsaw.Pension funds, created in 1999, and mutual funds are among the biggest investors on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, managing 275 billion zloty of assets in February, according to the financial regulator and the Mutual Funds&rsquo; Chamber.The total value of companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange tripled to $153 billion since 2003, according to the bourse&rsquo;s data.Average daily turnover jumped more than four fold to around 1.4 billion zloty.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing more and more large offerings and local financial institutions have become big enough that it&rsquo;s worth doing stock broking business for them alone,&rdquo; said Gul at Credit Suisse.With assistance by Elisa Martinuzzi in Milan.Editors: Frank Connelly, Nathaniel Espino
