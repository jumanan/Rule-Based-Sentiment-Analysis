Rochdale Securities' bank analyst Dick Bove upgraded Citigroup (NYSE: 
) today from Neutral to Buy and raised his price target from $3.75 to $5 per share.
While today's upgrade makes the rating change official, Bove may have already well-telegraphed his more positive stance on Citigroup.Â  Bove appeared on a number of TV shows making positive comments on the stock in recent weeks. In fact on Friday, Bove told Yahoo!'s 
 that the shares could move to around $8.50 per share within several years.
