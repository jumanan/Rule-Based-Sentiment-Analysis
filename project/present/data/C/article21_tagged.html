Mexico, whose stock market and peso have been soaring this year,<b><font color='firebrick'> received another stamp of approval yesterday after Citigroup Inc. C/NYSE</font></b> said the country's bonds are eligible to be included in its world government bond index WGBI , making it the first Latin American country in the closely watched index.Mexico's eligibility for the index, a move markets had been anticipating in recent weeks, could spur greater flows into Mexican bonds since the WGBI is used as a benchmark by major funds.Mexico's peso jumped on the news to its strongest level in more than 17 months.It has gained 6.1% this year, making it the best performer among the 16 most traded currencies in the world so far in 2010.Its main stock index, the IPC, hit a record high of 33589.05 on Tuesday,<b><font color='green'> gaining on a rebound in exports</font></b> to the United States.Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry raised its 2010 growth forecast to 4.1% from 3.9%.The turnaround has been swift after it was hit last year by downgrades by two ratings agencies to its sovereign debt."This is definitely positive," said Jaime Ascencio, an analyst at brokerage Actinver in Mexico City."The peso will stay in favour."

Citigroup said an index of Mexico's peso denominated government debt had satisfied criteria of liquidity, having an investment grade rating, and a<b><font color='red'> lack</font></b> of<b><font color='red'> barriers</font></b> to foreign entry in the market."If Mexico continues to meet all WGBI criteria for three consecutive months starting with the April 2010 index profile, it will become the first Latin American and the 24th government bond market to enter the WGBI.Entry would be effective October 2010," Citi said in a statement.Mexico began issuing larger amounts of new bonds this quarter through sales by syndicates of banks as a way to try to meet Citi's criteria for inclusion in the index.Citigroup said about US$2 trillion in funds are indexed to the WGBI.Mexico's debt would make up 0.64% of the index, so its inclusion could spur around US$12 billion in flows to Mexico, Citigroup said.Siobhan Morden, a debt strategist at RBS in Stamford, Conn., said about US$5 billion of the US$12 billion in flows projected by Citigroup had already bought into Mexico's debt in anticipation of the news."There are still some follow through gains," Mr. Morden said.The yield on the government's benchmark 10 year peso bond bid down four basis points to 7.60%."This says that the fundamentals of the country are positive and, obviously, much more money will keep entering Mexico," said Ramses Villela, a trader at Bulltick Capital Markets in Mexico City.Get the National Post newspaper delivered to your home
