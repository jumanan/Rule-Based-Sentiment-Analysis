Nokia (NYSE: NOK) NewsBite - NOK Rises after Research In Motion's (RIMM) Earnings Miss
Posted: Thursday, April 01, 2010 9:50 AM EDT 
Nokia (NYSE: NOK) opened at $15.81. So far today, the stock has hit a low of $15.79 and a high of $15.84. NOK is now trading at $15.83, up $0.29 (1.83%). Over the last 52 weeks the stock has ranged from a low of $11.46 to a high of $16.58. NOK shares are rising after competitor Research In Motion 
 reported fourth-quarter earnings, revenue, and shipments below analysts' forecasts. While RIMM shares have sunk following the announcement, NOK is up in early trading, as some analysts said after RIMM's report that the company could be losing market share in smartphones, creating an opening for other companies like NOK. Technical indicators for the stock are bullish and S&P gives NOK a positive 4 STARS (out of 5) buy ranking. If you are looking for a hedged play on NOK the stock seems like it could be a candidate for a July out-of-the-money bull-put credit spread below the 13 range.
