 March 25, 2010, 1:43 p.m. EDT US Stocks Climb To 18 Month Highs;<b><font color='green'> Disney,American Express Lead By Peter</font></b> A. McKay  Remarks from economic policy makers in the U.S., Europe, and Dubai pushed the stock market to an 18 month high Thursday.Commodities also rose, Treasury prices fell, and the dollar held steady as traders resumed their recent foray into riskier areas of the financial markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was recently on track to post its third triple digit daily point gain this month,<b><font color='green'> up 108.83</font></b> points, or 1%, at 10944.98, led by gains of nearly 3% each in Walt Disney and American Express.At its intraday peak of 10951.25, the Dow was at its highest point since Sept. 29, 2008.The average is also within reach of its first close above the key 11000 level since that date, when it plunged 778 points following the House's initial rejection of legislation creating the Troubled Asset Relief Program.Policy makers' latest remarks reinforced participants' confidence that borrowing costs will remain low for now and that sovereign borrowers will be able to service their debt."The market is not showing any signs of giving out, even with some of the round number levels that are coming up for the major averages," said strategist Bruce Bittles, of R.W.Baird & Co. "The round numbers usually become resistance areas, but I don't think we'll necessarily see that this time, given all the momentum that's been out there."  Aside from the 11000 mark for the Dow, traders are keeping an eye on the S&P 500's push within reach of 1200.The broad index recently traded 1% higher at 1179.78, led by a 2.4% jump in its financial sector after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke reiterated in congressional testimony that the U.S. central bank is likely to keep interest rates low for now.Bank stocks, which tend to be especially rate sensitive, posted solid gains.Citigroup was up 5.3%, J.P. Morgan Chase rose 2.3%, and Goldman Sachs was up 2.2%.Bank of America jumped 4.2% as it extended gains from Wednesday when the bank announced it would reduce mortgage loan balances by as much as 30% for many troubled borrowers.Traders also welcomed remarks from European Central Bank President Jean Claude Trichet, who effectively removed a threat that the central bank might not lend against the security of Greek bonds next year.The statement came ahead of a two day gathering of European leaders that began Thursday, during which Greece is widely expected to make a formal request for financial aid from its euro zone neighbors to help it refinance more than EUR20 billion $26.65 billion of maturing debt.The dollar, which had rallied strongly against the euro on Wednesday due to concerns about both Greece and heavily indebted Portugal, held steady in recent action.One euro cost $1.3345, up from $1.3325 late Wednesday.The U.S. Dollar Index was little changed.Also easing investors' worries over sovereign debt, Dubai's government said it will inject about $9.5 billion into Dubai World and real estate developer Nakheel while offering creditors a full repayment financed by fresh borrowing over eight years.The plans follow months of doubt over whether Dubai World could pay its debts.Thursday's U.S. economic releases were also encouraging.Initial claims for jobless benefits fell 14,000 to 442,000 for the week ended March 20, bigger than the drop of 7,000 economists had expected.In addition, manufacturing activity in the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's district continued to grow solidly in March, and expectations and employment rebounded this month, according to data released by the bank.Crude oil futures rose above $81 a barrel, while gold futures edged higher.Treasury prices fell.The 10 year note was down 12/32 to yield 3.895%.Donna Kardos Yesalavich contributed to this article .Sears starts to look like a retailer again
