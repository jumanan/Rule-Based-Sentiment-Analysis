BAC , a subsidiary of Merck & Co., polluted the Beachwood area's soil and groundwater with Chromium 6, a carcinogen.From 1969 to about 1991 a wood treatment process at the site leached the toxin into the soil, the suit alleges, and the company failed to notify residents of the danger.That pollution allegedly caused illness and death in the neighborhood.While the trial in Judge Oliver Wanger's court is set for Nov. 23, the two sides have been arguing over the science of the case.One point of contention is whether there's any evidence showing a direct pathway from the contaminated groundwater and soil to residents in the area.In the midst of this process, new filings from March 15 reveal that pollution modeling by Merck's own consultants Arcadis, a cleanup company showed the plume of polluted groundwater had already contaminated a public drinking well run by the Meadowbrook Water Co., according to the plaintiffs' lawyers.But that finding was stricken from official documents before it was made public.Now Merck's lawyers<b><font color='red'> are arguing that very same pathway model</font></b> shouldn't be admissible in the case, according to lawyers for Beachwood's residents.For their part, Regional Water Quality Control Board officials said they were well aware of the plume and its potential to affect a water well, even if Merck<b><font color='red'> did omit such references from its documents</font></b>.The<b><font color='red'> omission</font></b>, the<b><font color='red'> plaintiffs</font></b>' lawyers<b><font color='red'> argue</font></b>,<b><font color='red'> is just part of a pattern by Merck of intentionally</font></b><b><font color='red'> manipulating the public record</font></b> to<b><font color='green'> avoid litigation about the possibility of pollution</font></b> related sickness.Merck's attorneys maintain that not only is there no evidence the pollution<b><font color='red'> caused illness among the plaintiffs</font></b>, but also that there<b><font color='green'> was never any manipulation of the documents</font></b>.A 2007 draft plan for cleanup at the site written by Merck's remediation company Arcadis said the toxic groundwater plume could contaminate some drinking wells in the area if it wasn't cleaned up.But in the final draft sent to the Regional Board, that language had been removed.It never showed up in an obvious way in the public record, according to filings."Groundwater modeling results suggest that contamination would migrate toward MWC 2 a drinking well ," stated part of the document that was ultimately omitted from the final version.The omitted section goes on to say if the contamination went uncleaned and reached certain testing wells, at least one drinking well would be contaminated within "five years."
