</br>
Here are the stocks that saw a bias toward call activity in the previous session.This filtered scan is based on the International Securities Exchange ISE  buy to open data.It looks for stocks where the previous day's call volume on the ISE is at least twice as great as the put volume.It then sorts the stocks based on the call volume.Since this is buy to open data, this can be a good source for finding stocks where optimism is emerging.Contrarians may want to focus on situations where there is call activity on stocks that are still in intermediate term downtrends.This would be a potentially cautionary sign .Companies included in today's scan results: CALPINE Corp.
