MARKET SNAPSHOT: U.S. Stocks Open Higher, Led By Boeing
Donna Kardos Yesalavich
 NEW YORK Dow Jones U.S. stocks opened slightly higher Friday, led by the industrial sector after Boeing said it would boost aircraft production on an expected increase in demand.The Dow Jones Industrial Average  was up 24 points, or 0.2%, to 10802.It reached a fresh 17 month intraday high at 10,819.90.Boeing  was the measure's best performer, up 2.9%, after the company announced plans to raise production of its 777 and 747 aircraft earlier than anticipated amid increasing demand in the airplane industry.Alcoa<b><font color='green'> was also particularly strong</font></b>,<b><font color='green'> up 1.1</font></b>%.The Nasdaq Composite  edged up 0.2%.The Standard & Poor's 500 index  also rose 0.2%, with all its sectors except energy in the black.The industrial sector led the measure's gainers, while energy's underperformance came on a drop in crude oil futures below $82 a barrel.In other markets, the dollar strengthened against the euro and the yen.Gold futures declined and Treasurys edged lower, with the 10 year note down 5/32 to yield 3.695%.The dollar's strength against the euro came amid confusion over possible financial aid for heavily indebted Greece and expectations of a new Greek bond issue that would test investors' willingness to finance its red ink.Germany now appears to favor to a joint package by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund that is so far undefined and untested.That could lead to a confrontation with other European Union members.French President Nicolas Sarkozy and European Central Bank President Jean Claude Trichet have led opposition to IMF involvement, arguing the euro zone should handle the Greek debt crisis internally.In the U.S. the health care sector is in focus as Democrats are making a final sprint toward a weekend vote on their health care bill, pressuring wavering lawmakers as the Congressional Budget Office put the cost of the legislation at what party leaders see as a politically palatable $940 billion over the next decade.With a handful of votes still in doubt, President Barack Obama canceled a long planned trip to Asia to stay and lobby lawmakers, fighting for every vote in advance of a showdown on the House floor expected Sunday.Among stocks in focus, Palm  plunged 19%.The company reported a narrower quarterly loss but warned of significantly lower revenue in the current quarter amid disappointing sales of its latest smart phones.American depositary shares of Lloyds Banking Group  jumped 10%.The bank surprised investors and shareholders by saying it expects to return to profit this year as its trading performance picked up and impairments eased after two years of hefty losses.Friday's session could be impacted by quadruple witching, when contracts for stock index futures, stock index options, stock options and single stock futures all expire.Quadruple witching tends to increase volume and volatility.Copyright &copy; 2009 Dow Jones Newswires
