Shares rose Tuesday for Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. on news that the companies are heating up competition in the server market.
Santa Clara-based Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) closed at $22.01, up 4 percent, after going up to $22.04 during the day's trading. Sunnyvale-based AMD (NYSE:AMD) closed at $9.40, up more than 5 percent, after reaching $9.42.
On Tuesday Intel launched the newest version of its Xeon processor, which it said is more energy-efficient and secure than earlier iterations.
AMD is expected later this month to introduce the latest version of its Opteron server processor.
