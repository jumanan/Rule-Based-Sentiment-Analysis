Posted on 4/6/2010 in  An interesting spread trade surfaced in  late Monday.Shares of the pharmaceutical maker slipped 18 cents to $16.90 and one strategist was focused on the June 17 19 call spread.To be specific, they bought 20,000 June 17 calls at 56 cents and sold 20,000 June 19 calls at 8 cents.Therefore, this debit spread was initiated at 48 cents and offers a possible $1.52 pay off excluding commissions if shares of Pfizer rally to $19 or more by the June options expiration.Bullish trading was also seen in Panera Bread PNRA , Las Vegas Sands LVS International Game Technology IGT , a Baton Rouge, LA heavy construction equipment company, saw an uptick in put activity ahead of earnings.The company is due to release earnings Wednesday afternoon.Shares finished Monday's session up 47 cents to $35.62.In the options market, 2,900 puts and 590 calls traded on the session.Traders were focused on the April 35 and 34 puts, with 2065 and 464 contracts traded, respectively.Since these are short term options that are slightly out of the money, the action looks like defensive activity or bearish trading in anticipation of some post earnings volatility in shares of SHAW.Bearish trading also surfaced in Briggs and Stratton BGG FX Options &ndash; A New Way to Trade

 Trading remains very light in the index pits.About 312,000 calls and 491,000 puts traded across all the cash indexes Monday, or about 69 percent the recent average daily volume.The top two trades were in the S&P 500 Index SPX , which added 9.3 points to 1187.44 on the session.In midday action, a position in 20,000 July 1200 calls were apparently sold at $33 and spread against 20000 September 1225 calls at $34.05 per contract.This "diagonal spread" costs $1.05 per spread and is possibly a play on the index holding below 1,200 through mid July and then rallying from that point forward, or through the September expiration.US Natural Gas Fund UNG , the fund that tracks the commodity through futures, gained 37 cents to $7.66 after natural gas prices rose 18 cents to $4.27 Monday.Options action heated up as well, with about 84,000 calls and 92,000 puts traded on the fund.The biggest trades of the day were in the July 7 9 put spread, which traded at $1.27, 19650X.It appears the spread was sold and that an investor sold to close a defensive position in the July 9 puts to buy to open a similar position in the July 7 puts.This article is provided for informational purposes only.No statement in this article should be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell a security or to provide investment advice.The content provided has been obtained from sources deemed reliable but is not guaranteed as to accuracy and completeness.optionsXpress makes every effort to provide timely information to its recipients but cannot guarantee specific delivery times due to factors beyond our control.Derivatives involve substantial risk and are not appropriate for all investors.Please read the "Disclosure Statement for Futures and Options"
