&laquo; Back to &#8220;Note of the Day &mdash; A Collection of Ideas&#8221;
What if Nokia Operating Margins Keep<b><font color='red'> Declining</font></b>?March 17th, 2010 by  have declined in recent years as a result of competition with  NASDAQ:RIMM , Samsung and LG.Â  The company&#8217;s mobile phone operating margins decreased from about 20% in 2007 to around 13% in 2009.Â  Although we<b><font color='green'> expect a rebound in Nokia&</font></b>#8217;s operating margins, there could be a downside of about $7 to the $26 Trefis price estimate for Nokia&#8217;s stock
 if Nokia margins were to remain flat over our forecast period and<b><font color='green'> even greater downside</font></b> if margins<b><font color='red'> continue to decline</font></b>.We believe Nokia&#8217;s<b><font color='red'> operating margin declines</font></b> are attributable to three factors:
1.Â<b><font color='red'>   Declining Nokia Mobile Phone</font></b> Pricing
Pricing of Nokia mobile phones<b><font color='red'> has declined at a fast rate for the last few years. Â   Pricing in India</font></b>, China, Brazil fell from Euro 71 in 2007 to Euro 54 in 2009, while pricing in  US, Canada, UK, Germany fell from Euro 121 to Euro 91 during the same period.2.Â <b><font color='red'> Declining Nokia Market Share Concurrent with</font></b><b><font color='red'> falling prices on Nokia mobile phones</font></b>, the company&#8217;s market share<b><font color='red'> has also declined</font></b>.We estimate that Nokia&#8217;s market share in<b><font color='red'> declined from 44 % in 2007</font></b> to 40% in 2009, while market share in<b><font color='red'> fell</font></b> from 30% to 27%.3.Â  Increasing R&D Expenses with Respect to Revenue
Nokia has been investing heavily in research and development R&D and<b><font color='green'> has been working on improvements</font></b> to its Symbian and Maemo Operating Systems.Â  Nokia&#8217;s R&D as percentage of revenue<b><font color='green'> increased from 7.6 % in 2007</font></b> to 10.7% in 2009.Â  We<b><font color='green'> believe improvements</font></b> to the Nokia mobile phone operating systems and the associated software are a key to<b><font color='green'> competing effectively with mobile phones from Apple</font></b> and RIM that have superior operating systems.Emerging Markets Operating Margin is Most Important
We believe that Nokia&#8217;s operating margin in emerging markets is the most important.Â  We estimate that Nokia&#8217;s emerging markets business constitutes 71% of the Trefis estimate for Nokia&#8217;s stock.<b><font color='green'> Operating Margin Improvements Expected We</font></b> expect<b><font color='green'> improvements</font></b> to both Nokia&#8217;s Emerging Markets Operating Margin
Developed Markets Operating Margin
.Â  We believe that introduction of higher priced smartphones in emerging markets will help improve Nokia&#8217;s average mobile phone pricing,<b><font color='red'> slow declines</font></b> in market share and<b><font color='green'> lead</font></b> to<b><font color='green'> improvements</font></b> in operating margins.Â  As a result, combined margins are expected to<b><font color='green'> improve from 13 % in 2009</font></b> to 20% by the end of Trefis forecast period.What if Operating Margin Decline Continued?However, if mobile phones price were to increase at a slower rate due to increased competition from Apple and RIM, it may mean additional downside to our operating margin forecast.If Nokia&#8217;s operating margins were to remain constant in , it could<b><font color='red'> mean a loss of</font></b> $7 to the $26 Trefis price estimate for Nokia&#8217;s stock
