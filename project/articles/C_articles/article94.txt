Citibank (NYSE: C) Downgrades Abbot Laboratories (NYSE: ABT)

Citibank (NYSE: C) has downgraded Abbot Laborites from a “Hold” rating to a “Sell” rating, because of signs that the company may face profitability trouble in 2010.
Citi simultaneously raised the company’s price target to $52.00, up from $46.00.
Citibank analyst Matthew Dodds said, &#8220;ABT appears to be masking underlying profitability trouble in &#8216;10 with larger accretion from Solvay than forecast. The Solvay EPS lift should trail off in &#8216;11. With a thin pipeline, this only increases ABT&#8217;s dependence on Humira, in our view.&#8221;
Dodds added, &#8220;ABT appears to be understating an overall margin slide for its base business as we calculate Solvay accretion at nearly $0.30 in 2010. This compares to management guidance of just $0.10 and we are surprised how little attention this low number has received to date.&#8221;
For 2010, the bank expects the company to report earnings per share of $4.18, versus consensus estimates of $4.24.
