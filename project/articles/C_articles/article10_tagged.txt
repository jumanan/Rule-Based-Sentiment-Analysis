 Stocks in Asia closed mixed today, European shares are up, and U.S. shares are pointing to a lower open.As the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates around an all time low, a growing concern is whether inflation is around the corner.When the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC releases its minutes today at 2:00 p.m., it will shed light on the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s last meeting, and possibly the future of interest rates.The key language that Wall Street will be looking for is whether the FOMC plans to keep the federal funds rate at &ldquo;exceptionally low levels&rdquo; for &ldquo;an extended period,&rdquo; as was mentioned in the Committee&rsquo;s last minutes from March 16.An extended period of time could mean six months or more, says Robert Johnson, associate director of economic analysis at Morningstar.That would be far too long and could cause inflation to pick up steam, adds Johnson.Besides concern on Wall Street, this issue appears to be creating dissent in the Fed, according to recent news reports, between whether low rates will lead to inflation or cause it to slow further.Some analysts believe that the sheer presence of dissent could mean that rates will probably change &ndash; even if by a little &ndash; soon.The main purpose to keeping rates low is to help banks shore up their balance sheets by paying less when they borrow and making a bigger profit when they lend.Low rates have also helped the equities market, in particular oil and the emerging markets, which financial institutions have bought in heavy volume, says Johnson.Should the Fed raise rates, the most immediate impact will likely be that the commodities market &ndash; which many traders have flocked to for protection &ndash; will become more expensive.&ldquo;As interest rates increase, those bets become more expensive to maintain and it makes them less profitable,&rdquo; he says.With rates low, unemployment still high and income not rising, some question if we could see deflation.In a report, David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, points to the drop in average hourly earnings in the March employment report as a result in part of excess supply in the jobs market.&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think for a second that the Fed is not aware of or sensitive to the deflationary pressures that continue to build in the labour market,&rdquo; he writes.Others say that fewer job losses and increased job creation could be a sign that the markets can recover without artificially low rates.&ldquo;If the rest of the dataflow this month proves healthy, we believe the Fed will consider removing the &lsquo;extended period&rsquo; language at the April 28 FOMC meeting and start hiking rates in September,&rdquo; writes Michelle Meyer, a senior economist at Barclays Capital, in a note.Find More Articles About:
