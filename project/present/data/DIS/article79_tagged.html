Buoyed by a 98% surge in revenue, IMAX  posted a stronger than expected non GAAP profit on Thursday and issued a bullish outlook for the current quarter.Benefiting from record shattering sales from "Avatar," IMAX said it earned $4 million, or 6 cents a share, last quarter, compared with a loss of $9 million, or 21 cents a share, in the year earlier period.The movie theater operator said it earned 20 cents a share on a non GAAP basis.IMAX said its revenue climbed 98% to $54.2 million.Analysts had been looking for EPS of 6 cents and revenue of just $45.3 million.IMAX was upbeat on the current quarter as the company said its box office to date sales total $187 million, compared to $14 million at the same point of 2009.In addition to “Avatar,” which was produced by FOX Business parent News Corp.  , IMAX has been helped by Walt Disney’s  “Alice in Wonderland.”

"While the<b><font color='green'> success</font></b> of Fox's 'Avatar: An IMAX 3D Experience' drove our year end performance and has provided a very strong start to 2010, we believe the film has many positive implications for our business over the long term,”  Richard Gelfond said in a statement.“A significant number of moviegoers around the world experienced IMAX for the first time, which we believe has added new repeat customers to our theatres and reinforced the power of The IMAX Experience with both studios and exhibitors.”
