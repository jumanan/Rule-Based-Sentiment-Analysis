Two kinds of call selling in Potash POT and Exxon Mobil XOM Opening trades in Exxon and closing trades in Potash  by Yesterday<b><font color='red'> was a slow one in the options</font></b> trading pits, as<b><font color='red'> spring breaks</font></b>, Passover, and Holy Week observations took many traders away from the market.Fewer than 14 million option contracts changed hands, down from the March average of 15.6 million.Among some mega cap names, however, we did see some interesting call selling action, some of which was to open and some of which was to close.Potash Corp./Saskatchewan NYSE:
</br>
 saw a block of 5,000 contracts<b><font color='red'> hit the tape late</font></b> morning at the June 120 call.These traded near the bid price of $9.90, which was the first indication that they may have been initiated by a seller.Secondly, by the day&#8217;s close, the call had lost 52 cents compared to a 19 cent drop in POT shares to $120.53.The fact that the option declined actually  than the stock indicates that implied volatility was likely coming in, probably as a result of selling pressure.Open interest on the stock decreased slightly this morning, suggesting that this block of 5,000 calls was sold to close.After rallying 20% from February 25th through March 17th, POT has stabilized of late.What&#8217;s more, this sideways trend is occurring around the 125 level, which acted as resistance in December and January.Perhaps yesterday&#8217;s call sellers are hoping to take some profits off the table or at least free up capital if POT will potentially be range bound for a while.saw call selling action at its May 60 call.These options definitely traded to open, as open interest at the in the money strike rose from 119 on Monday to 10,038 this morning.Two large blocks traded in rapid succession in early afternoon trading, going off at an average price of $7.58.According to our sources on the floor, these trades were sold to open.These may have been sold to open in order to hedge an existing long stock position, but let&#8217;s assume that they are &#8220;uncovered,&#8221; or &#8220;naked&#8221; shorted calls without the protection of another option contract or long stock .This would be rather unusual because the call in question is in the money, meaning XOM would have to drop below 60 an 11% drop from current levels in order to make these options profitable at expiration.Potential profit is limited to the premium received in this case, $7.58 per contract .Breakeven, meanwhile, is $67.58, or slightly above where Exxon is currently trading.Risk is theoretically unlimited if the stock rallies.If the investor already owns XOM stock, maximum loss is dependent on the purchase price of the shares but is offset by the premium collected for selling the call .Of course, the call seller could chose to buy them back at a higher price should Exxon move lower in the coming weeks , booking a small profit and relieving himself of the obligation to sell Exxon shares at 60.Want to dig deeper into this trade?Build your own profit & loss calculator or check out the probability of this option finishing in the money at expiration.Both of these tools are available for use with a virtual trading account
