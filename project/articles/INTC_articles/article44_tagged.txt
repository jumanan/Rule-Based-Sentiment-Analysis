New Server Processor Could Mean Upside to Intel&#8217;s Stock
March 19th, 2010 by  NASDAQ:INTC ,Â which competes with  NYSE:AMD in the server processor market, has expanded its lineup of x86 server processors by introducing the Xeon 5600, the first 32nm process technology based processor.Â  If the Xeon 5600 helps Intel to recapture the 8% server processor market share it<b><font color='red'> lost to AMD over the past few years</font></b>, there could be an upside of about 6% to our $22 Trefis price estimate for Intel&#8217;s stock
Below we explain the significance of Intel&#8217;s server processor business and highlight how the Xeon 5600<b><font color='green'> is superior in comparison</font></b> to previous generation server processors.Â  We show how an<b><font color='green'> 8 % increase</font></b> in Intel&#8217;s server processor market share as a result of the Xeon 5600 could lead to an upside of 6% to Trefis price estimate.Server Processors 24% of Intel&#8217;s Stock
We estimate that Intel&#8217;s server processor business constitutes 24% of the $22 Trefis price estimate for Intel&#8217;s stock
.Â  Server processors are more important for Intel than the desktop PC processors found in many PCs sold today.Xeon 5600 is Better Than Previous Generation Server Processors
The Xeon 5600 is a six core computing processor that will be targeted at the servers used in large businesses and corporate data centers.Â  Many businesses will be undergoing IT infrastructure upgrades as the economy recovers and Intel&#8217;s timing could prove to be favorable.Â  We believe that next generation processors like the Xeon 5600 will prompt server makers like HP, IBM and Dell upgrade their server offerings despite the higher pricing of the new processors.Below are two primary factors that make Intelâ€™<b><font color='green'> s Xeon 5600 series attractive</font></b> to server manufacturers:
1.Better performance with less hardware
Xeon 5600 is designed to deliver 60% greater performance than the previous 45 nm generation of processors.Intel indicates that data centers can replace 15 single core servers with one Xeon powered server and achieve a return on their investment in as little as five months.2.Power efficiency:
Xeon 5600 offers 30% greater power efficiency for the same performance output as compared to Xeon 5500 series.Xeon Processor 5600 Can Drive Market Share<b><font color='green'> Gains For Intel We</font></b> believe the demand for the next generation Xeon 5600 processors can help Intel<b><font color='red'> slow further market share</font></b><b><font color='red'> declines</font></b> and has the potential to<b><font color='red'> reverse the market share losses</font></b> to AMD that occurred in recent years.Â  Intelâ€™s server processor market share
 saw steep<b><font color='red'> declines</font></b> until 2008 due to<b><font color='green'> strong competition</font></b> from AMDâ€™s lower priced and energy efficient Opteron processors.Intel<b><font color='green'> gained slight market share in 2009 by improving its offerings over AMD in the latter half of 2009. Â   We</font></b> expect Intelâ€™s server processor market share to<b><font color='green'> rise above our current forecast level of 70.5 % in 2010</font></b>.Demand for cloud computing is driving the need for high performance server processors that offer improved security and power consumption.Â  Intelâ€™s next generation Xeon processor is well positioned to benefit the server processor requirements of businesses.8% Gain In Server Processor Share Will Lead to 6% Upside for Intelâ€™s Stock
We estimate that a gain in market share of close to 8% in 2010 can<b><font color='green'> lead</font></b> to 6% upside to the Trefis price estimate for Intel&#8217;s stock.Â  You can modify our forecast  to see how Intelâ€™s stock could be impacted if Xeon 5600 processors<b><font color='green'> are successful</font></b> and<b><font color='green'> lead</font></b> to an<b><font color='green'> increase</font></b> in Intel&#8217;s server market share.For additional forecasts and analysis, here is our complete model for Intel&#8217;s stock.Higher Intel Notebook and Server Processor Margins Can<b><font color='green'> Boost Intel&</font></b>#8217;s Stock
