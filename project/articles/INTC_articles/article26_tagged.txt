Mar.27 A Wauwatosa group has raised about $25 million for a venture capital fund that will invest in information technology and life sciences companies in Wisconsin and the Midwest.Organizers say they expect Capital Midwest Fund II to make about half its investment in high growth potential companies in Wisconsin."The region is undercapitalized, and funds that launch in a recession year outperform other funds," said Teresa Esser, one of the fund's general partners.The new venture fund is a welcome addition to the state's sparse funding landscape for fast growing companies ready to move beyond so called angel investments into bigger rounds.It is also one of several recent signs of activity in this area.Newer players on the state's venture capital scene include: Calumet Venture Fund, which said last month it has almost $10 million; and Peak Ridge Capital's AgTech Fund, which does not disclose its size but has made two investments in the state: Rapid Diagnostek Inc., Hudson, and Local Dirt, Madison.Business and government leaders from Milwaukee and Madison, led by investment adviser Dick Schilffarth, said in January that they are trying to raise a $100 million fund.The group has tagged Credit Suisse First Boston LLC to manage the Wisconsin based fund, Schilffarth has said.Still, Wisconsin has just $199 million of venture capital under management, according to the 2010 National Venture Capital Association Yearbook.That ranks it 26th in the United States, far behind big venture capital centers such as California and Massachusetts, but also below neighboring states such as Illinois, Minnesota and Michigan."We're really lagging behind in the region," said John Neis, a senior partner at Madison based Venture Investors.Venture Investors is the biggest venture capital firm based in the state, with $118 million under management.'Valley of Death' 
The lack of venture capital can be a huge obstacle for companies in industries such as drug development that need funding to keep growing."It can be a Valley of Death for these emerging companies," said Tom Still, president of the Wisconsin Technology Council."We've done a really good job in Wisconsin of having angel backed companies that can rise to a certain level, but it's important to provide that next level of funding so these companies can truly take root here and grow." 
The state has 22 angel investing groups up from six in 2005 that put money into very young companies in the early stages of development, Still said.Subscribe to Rate this Commentary
