 opened at $15.81.So far today, the stock has hit a low of $15.79 and a high of $15.84.NOK is now trading at $15.83, up $0.29 1.83% .Over the last 52 weeks the stock has ranged from a low of $11.46 to a high of $16.58.NOK shares are rising after competitor Research In Motion  reported fourth quarter earnings, revenue, and shipments below analysts' forecasts.While RIMM shares have sunk following the announcement, NOK is up in early trading, as some analysts said after RIMM's report that the company could be losing market share in smartphones, creating an opening for other companies like NOK.Technical indicators for the stock are bullish and S&P; gives NOK a positive 4 STARS out of 5 buy ranking.If you are looking for a hedged play on NOK the stock seems like it could be a candidate for a July out of the money bull put credit spread below the 13 range.RIMM Research In Motion  Yesterday after market close, Research In Motion Ltd. RIMM : 70.02, 0.17 declared its fourth quarter fiscal 2010 financial results.The results were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Consequently, stock price was down $3.42 4.62% to $70.55 in after market trade on Nasdaq.Nevertheless, management provided a solid financial guidance for the ongoing first quarter of fiscal 2011, which may act as a silver lining for the stock in the near term.Fourth quarter 2010 total revenue of $4.08 billion was up 18% year over year and 4% sequentially.However, the quarterly revenue was far below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.30 billion.This was primarily due to lower BlackBerry device shipment of 10.5 million units compared to the average expectation of 11 million units.RIMM claimed that the lower device shipment was due to inventory reduction by a major wireless service provider.Although BlackBerry still holds its market leadership position in the North American region, it seems the company is losing out to the iconic touchscreen smartphones of Apple Inc. AAPL : 237, 1.99 .The rally in Apple shares shows no signs of slowing down.Apple stock keeps hitting fresh 52 week highs and new all time highs almost each trading session.The stock is up nearly 15% since the company unveiled the iPad at a media event in late January, and has more than doubled from its level at this time last year.Shares have further got lift from reports that it may begin making its popular iPhone available for use on the Verizon Wireless network, breaking free from its exclusive relationship with AT&T; NYSE: VZ : 31.31, 0.28 in the U.S. At $213.10 billion, Apple is now the third most valuable company.Industry experts believe that Apple is also developing a next generation iPhone to debut this summer.As of now, Microsoft holds nearly a $50 billion lead over Apple.Assuming that all other things remain the same, Apple would have to increase to the $280 plus range to overtake Microsoft.Most analysts believe that now it's largely a question of 'When', not 'If.'
