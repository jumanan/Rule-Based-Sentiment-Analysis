  Short Term Speculators Expect Extended Winning Streak for Wynn Resorts, Limited
</br>
 Andrea Kramer akramer@sir inc.com  3/23/2010 12:50:28 PM Wynn Resorts, Limited WYNN saw call volume jump to nearly twice the expected levels on Monday, as casino stocks gained ground in the wake of an upbeat analyst endorsement for Las Vegas Sands Corp. LVS .By the closing bell, the stock had seen close to 11,000 contracts change hands, compared to its predicted single session volume of fewer than 6,000 contracts.The equity's out of the money April 80 call garnered the most attention, with almost 3,000 contracts exchanged.Almost half of the front month calls traded closer to the ask price, implying they were likely bought, and call open interest at the round number strike advanced by roughly 1,300 contracts overnight.In other words, it appears near term traders were initiating bullish bets at the April 80 strike.Yesterday's influx in call volume echoes the recent trend on the International Securities Exchange ISE , where speculators during the past two weeks have bought to open more than twice as many WYNN calls as puts.In fact, the security's 10 day call/put volume ratio of 2.06 ranks in the 97th percentile of its annual range, suggesting that traders on the ISE have scooped up WYNN calls over puts at a  pace only 3% of the time during the past year.In that same vein, the stock's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio SOIR has plunged to 1.18, in the 38th annual percentile.In other words, short term option players have been  optimistically aligned toward the gaming guru only 38% of the time during the past 52 weeks.After tagging a new high of $77.41, WYNN has since given back 1.5% to linger in the $75.40 region.View Most Recent Blogs

 Stocks are indicated higher after European markets moved up on optimism for Greece Friday.Thirty minutes before the opening bell on Wall Street, stock index futures indicate that both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the NASDAQ will open with modest gains.\n
</br>

</br>

</br>
\nIn the US, stock index futures also came off their best levels after a report on Durable Goods showed an unexpected decline of 1.3 percent in March.Economists were looking for an increase of .1 percent.\n
</br>
\nA report on New Home Sales comes into focus at 10:00 a.m. eastern time.Economists expect to see an increase to an annualized rate of 330K in March, up from 308K the month before.\n
</br>
\nBonds are under pressure ahead of the data and on diminishing concerns about Greece.The yield on the benchmark ten year Treasury is up to 3.81 percent, from 3.77 percent the day before.\n
</br>
\nSome of the commodity related names might see relative weakness after crude oil lost 55 cents to $83.15 a barrel and gold slipped $5.2 to $1137.70 an ounce.\n
</br>
\nMeanwhile, the days earnings news isnt inspiring either.Microsoft MSFT shares lost 1.3 percent after the company reported a 45 cent per share quarterly profit, which beat Street estimates by 3 cents, but revenues that didnt live up to some expectations.Dow components Travelers TRV and American Express AXP are seeing mixed post earnings action.TRV slipped 3 percent.AXP added 2.4 percent.\n Read more at WhatsTrading.com

  Fannie Mae FNM $1.21 0.82%
</br>

</br>
 Big Prints in Fannie Mae FNM after a strategist bought 52500 June 1 puts for .10 to sell 53000 January 2012 $1 puts at 29 cents.Shares are flat at $1.22.The action looks similar to trade seen on Feb 5 when a strategist sold the Mar Jan 2012 $1 put spread 118,000X which was apparently a roll from Mar to Jan2012s.Today's spread looks the same and is possibly a premium seller willing to buy shares at $1 minus the money collected for selling puts should FNM dip back below $1 per share by the January 2012 expiration.Read more at WhatsTrading.com
