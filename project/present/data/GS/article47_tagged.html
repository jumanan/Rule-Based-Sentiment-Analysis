</br>
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
</br>
’<b><font color='green'> s largest internal hedge fund</font></b>, is
</br>
retiring from the world’<b><font color='green'> s most profitable securities firm</font></b> to
</br>
start a hedge fund, according to three people with knowledge of
</br>
his plans.Flamand, 39, has worked at Goldman Sachs for 15 years and
</br>
has run Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies from London since
</br>
2007.He didn’t respond to calls or e mails seeking comment.A
</br>
Goldman Sachs executive in London confirmed the departure and
</br>
said the company supports Flamand’s plan.Flamand is setting up his own fund as Wall Street pay and
</br>
proprietary trading come under increased scrutiny from
</br>
lawmakers.<b><font color='lime'> Goldman Sachs Investment Partners</font></b>, founded by a
</br>
former principal strategies team, was transformed into a hedge
</br>
fund managing $7 billion in 2008 and became part of Goldman’s
</br>
asset management unit.“Goldman Sachs is the best money making machine in the
</br>
world but compensation<b><font color='red'> is subject</font></b> to public policy if you go
</br>
private it’s your own business,” said , chief
</br>
executive officer of Laven Partners LLP, a London based hedge
</br>
fund consultancy.“You could have been the best prop trader in
</br>
the world and you would have been paid less last year than you
</br>
might have expected.” Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies<b><font color='red'> rebounded from losses in 2008</font></b> to fuel the firm’s<b><font color='green'> 7 percent gain</font></b> in equity revenues to
</br>
$9.89 billion in 2009, according to its annual report.The
</br>
business seeks to profit from discrepancies in relative values
</br>
of financial instruments, convertible bonds and “various types
</br>
of volatility trading,” according to the report.“Results in principal strategies<b><font color='green'> were positive</font></b><b><font color='red'> compared with losses in 2008</font></b>,” Goldman said in its 10 K filing with the
</br>
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.That helped make up for
</br>
a reduction in revenue in the rest of Goldman Sachs’s equities
</br>
business last year, according to the filing.Before 2007, Flamand was head of Goldman Sachs Principal
</br>
Strategies in Europe from 2002.While his background at Goldman
</br>
will help lure investors, he’ll face a more<b><font color='red'> challenging fund</font></b> raising environment than his fellow Goldman Sachs veterans who
</br>
set up their own firms, said Lussan.<b><font color='lime'> Former Goldman Sachs partner</font></b>  founded Eton Park
</br>
Capital Management LP with $3 billion in 2004.“There’s so much less appetite today, if he gets a billion
</br>
to start today it’ll be a massive launch,” said Lussan.“The
</br>
world has a lot less means than it used to.” To contact the reporter on this story:
