Doug Myers, president of United Steelworkers of America Local 309, said union and management will start meeting in late April."We will be meeting April 22 to exchange proposals, and negotiations won't start until May 17," he said.Neither side wished to talk about any issues yet."I wouldn't want to discuss anything until we have had a chance to meet and exchange proposals," Myers said.Christy Newman, spokeswoman for Alcoa's Tennessee Operations, said the company has set up a Web site where it will share updates on the negotiations.Myers said he had heard that Alcoa was lining up some of its retirees to work in case of a strike, but said this is nothing unusual."They usually take some precautions," he said.In its current newsletter, Alcoa Inc. says its goal is to reach a fair and competitive labor agreement before the contract expires and<b><font color='green'> avoid a work stoppage</font></b>.Although a strike could occur if an agreement is not reached by May 31, it is difficult to say what would actually happen, Myers said.It is conceivable an agreement could be reached that would have workers continue for a while without a contract, but he emphasized this is speculation."We won't know what is going to happen until we exchange proposals," Myers said.During negotiations for the present contract in 2006, a strike by 9,000 workers at 15 plants was narrowly avoided when Alcoa Inc. and the United Steelworkers reached an agreement two hours before the old contract was set to expire.Business writer Ed Marcum may be reached at 865 342 6267.&copy; 2010, Knoxville News Sentinel Co.
