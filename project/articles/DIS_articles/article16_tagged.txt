 By Donna Kardos  Updates with additional company information, beginning in the eighth paragraph.NEW YORK MarketWatch U.S. stocks climbed broadly Thursday as better than expected data on jobs and manufacturing lifted a broad swath of stocks, including Walt Disney and Alcoa.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 70.44 points, or 0.65%, to 10927.07, its highest close since Sept. 26, 2008.With the stock market closed Friday, the Dow gained 0.71% this week, marking its fifth straight week of gains.That represents the Dow's longest weekly winning streak since April 2009.The measure was led by some of its most economically sensitive components.Alcoa was its best performer, with a jump of 46 cents, or 3.2%, to 14.70.Disney climbed 64 cents, or 1.8%, to 35.55, and Caterpillar rose 1.14, or 1.8%, to 63.99.The Nasdaq Composite advanced 4.62, or 0.19%, to 2402.58.The measure climbed 0.31% this week, its fifth consecutive week in the black and longest weekly winning streak since May.The Standard & Poor's 500 climbed 8.67, or 0.74%, to 1178.10, its highest close since Sept. 26, 2008.All of the S&P 500's sectors ended the session in the black, led by materials and energy.It rose 0.99% this week, its fifth straight positive week.U.S. manufacturing and weekly jobs data released Thursday came in above expectations, fueling more optimism among investors ahead of Friday's monthly jobs report from the Labor Department.Expectations for global growth also rose as two surveys on Chinese manufacturing showed quicker growth in March, the Bank of Japan's key business sentiment survey showed less pessimism and a U.K. manufacturing survey was at its strongest since 1994."Almost everywhere you look, the situation is better than what you expect," said Keith Springer, president of Capital Financial Advisory Services."The numbers are pretty good.They're not great, but we're coming out of it."  Still, he added, "tomorrow is critical because what it does is it either justifies the rally of the past year, or it doesn't."  American depositary shares of Lihir Gold Nasdaq jumped 7.45, or 26%, to 35.61, after the company rejected a A$9.2 billion $8.41 billion takeover offer from rival gold miner Newcrest Mining Nasdaq , which it said didn't reflect the value of the company's assets or offer a sufficient control premium.American depositary shares of Newcrest Mining edged up 74 cents, or 2.5%, to 31.Research in Motion Nasdaq fell 5.49, or 7.4%, to 68.48.The Blackberry maker's fiscal fourth quarter revenue and earnings came in below analysts' estimates, cementing concerns that its Blackberry phones are losing ground to higher profile smartphones.Ford Motor rose 6 cents, or 0.5%, to 12.63, after the auto maker reported a 43% increase in U.S. sales.The results helped boost shares of parts makers, including TRW Automotive Holdings TRW , which jumped 1.43, or 5%, to 30.01.Mosaic slumped 2.44, or 4%, to 58.33.The company's fiscal third quarter profit nearly quadrupled on increased sales of its fertilizers and lower phosphate raw materials costs.Still, its earnings and revenue fell short of analysts' expectations.CarMax climbed 96 cents, or 3.8%, to 26.08, after the auto dealer's fiscal fourth quarter earnings more than doubled, beating analysts' estimates, on strong used car sales.American depositary shares of Irish low budget airline Ryanair Holdings Nasdaq jumped 3.19, or 12%, to 30.36.The company raised its full year forecast for net profit, citing strong bookings on better than expected yields in late February and March.Foot Locker climbed 37 cents, or 2.5%, to 15.41, after FBR Capital Markets upgraded its investment rating on the athletic apparel retailer to outperform from market perform, citing improving same store sales helped by a stronger market for athletic footwear, international expansion and the closing of underperforming stores.BlackRock slipped 6.71, or 3.1%, to 211.05.Deutsche Bank cut its investment rating on the money management firm to hold from buy, predicting its growth won't be as impressive from here.BlackRock is set to focus on reinvesting for long term growth, and now there are asset flow headwinds to contend with, the firm wrote.Sears starts to look like a retailer again
