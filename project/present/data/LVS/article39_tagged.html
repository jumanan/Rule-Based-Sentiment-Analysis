Las Vegas Sands LVS "Many casino stocks nearly<b><font color='red'> went bankrupt during the recession</font></b>, but now the best ones are storming back for one reason: Macao, China, also known as the Las Vegas of China," states The Cabot Market Letter
</br>
 explains, "During the ﬁrst two months of 2010, gaming revenues in the region jumped a whopping 66% to $3.4 billion from a year ago which, admittedly, was a depressed period ."
</br>

</br>
Cintolo continues, "So far in March, reports have gaming revenue up 58% from a year ago.Some analysts see full year revenues surging 25% to 30% for the entire year to a new all time high.Both Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts are leveraging their casinos in Macao to boost growth.Moreover, there are rumblings that the government is going to limit the number of new casinos in the space, which will only increase the value and attractiveness of these ﬁrms' resorts.Granted, last year was a stinker for both of these companies, but revenue growth is beginning to accelerate, and analysts forecast huge earnings increases this year.We think both Las Vegas Sands  and Wynn Resorts  are beginning new, major advances.Even better, we love the chart patterns Las Vegas Sands NYSE: LVS , for example, spiked into September of last year, and then spent 24 weeks<b><font color='lime'> consolidating with very strong support in the mid</font></b> teens.The stock recently leaped to new high ground on huge volume.Meanwhile, our overall market indicator is bullish.It continues to post near ideal readings, with the number of stocks hitting new 52 week lows remaining in the single digits.Some day, when the indexes are hitting new highs, new lows will expand beyond 40 and stay there, giving us a warning that the bull move is entering its final stages.But there's no sign of that now!For now, the broad market remains very strong, which argues that this bull market has many months to run."
