 McWilliams covers these topics and more in his recent reports:  Following Qualcomm's disappointing calendar Q4 report last January, McWilliams assured Next Inning readers that calendar Q1 guidance would prove to be conservative, also writing that it would be best to wait patiently for the stock to drop into the $30s before adding shares.As the price of Qualcomm sank to that mark, he suggested it was time to accumulate shares.Now that Qualcomm has substantially raised its guidance and proven McWilliams correct, what has he suggested as an appropriate exit plan?What is McWilliams price target for Qualcomm during the second half of 2010?McWilliams first moved to a negative opinion on Palm last January when the stock was trading for over $12 and then he warned readers on March 11th that Palm was not nearly as attractive as an acquisition target as some pundits were suggesting.Why is it that McWilliams, who has said all along that the Palm Pre and Palm's webOS are both excellent products, is so down on Palm?Why, even with its huge patent portfolio, does McWilliams think there are few potential suitors who would be interested in the company?Does he really think Palm could literally go to zero?Why?After suggesting that Next Inning readers sell MEMC last October when it was trading in the mid $15s, the stock dropped like a rock.However, once it found a bottom, McWilliams reversed his stance and suggested it was time to buy the stock with thoughts of a cycle trade.He reiterated his buy call last month when the stock was trading for $12.60.Does McWilliams think it's time to sell now that the stock has popped back into the $15s or does he have another plan?Corning is up 140% since McWilliams advised Next Inning readers it should be considered a strategic buy late in 2008.When Wall Street analysts questioned Corning's ability to deliver the goods this year and pushed the stock down into the $17s last month, he boldly reiterated his call and stated that Wall Street's opinions were wrong.With the stock now trending towards its 52 week high, does McWilliams think it's time to take some profits or hold on for more gains?What is his estimated fair value range for Corning?Should Intel investors<b><font color='red'> be concerned that Acer</font></b> and Asustek will likely drop prices for netbook PCs running Intel's 270 and 280 series Atom microprocessors?Why might this actually<b><font color='green'> be good news for Intel</font></b>?Throughout 2009, analysts<b><font color='red'> were embarrassingly wrong in their Intel forecasts</font></b>.However, McWilliams always seemed to nail his within a rounding error.What is McWilliams' outlook for Intel this quarter?Founded in September 2002, Next Inning's model portfolio has returned 262% since its inception versus 29% for the S&P 500.About Next Inning:  Next Inning is a subscription based investment newsletter that provides regular coverage on more than 150 technology and semiconductor stocks.Subscribers receive intra day analysis, commentary and recommendations, as well as access to monthly semiconductor sales analysis, regular Special Reports, and the Next Inning model portfolio.Editor Paul McWilliams is a 30+ year semiconductor industry veteran.NOTE: This release was published by Indie Research Advisors, LLC, a registered investment advisor with CRD #131926.Interested parties may visit adviserinfo.sec.gov for additional information.Past performance does not guarantee future results.Investors should always research companies and securities before making any investments.Nothing herein should be construed as an offer or solicitation to buy or sell any security.CONTACT: Marcia Martin, Next Inning Technology Research, +1 888 278 5515  SOURCE Indie Research Advisors, LLC  Copyright C 2010 PR Newswire.All rights reserved U.S. suspects Goldman tip off on Buffett deal: WSJ
