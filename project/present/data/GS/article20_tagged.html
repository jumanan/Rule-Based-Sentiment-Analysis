Goldman's Image May Have Hurt Odds of Landing Citi Deal
</br>
For the past year, executives inside the image<b><font color='red'> challenged Goldman Sachs</font></b>  have debated whether the firm's<b><font color='red'> publicity problems</font></b> will have an impact on its bottom line.The answer so far has been â€˜noâ€™ given the firm's huge profits last year.Indeed, the big Wall Street firm has held off on plans for a major publicity plan designed to change public opinion.But times might be changing.The decision announced earlier Monday that the Treasury Department has chosen Morgan Stanley  to advise it on unloading its massive stake in Citigroup  the largest stock offering in history and one of the most high profile investment banking assignments in years has given credence to the opinion of some senior executives inside the firm that Goldman's<b><font color='red'> image problems</font></b> will impact its client related business.These executives<b><font color='red'> worried that prospective investment banking clients</font></b><b><font color='red'> concerned about their association with the firm</font></b> will simply<b><font color='red'> hire other players rather than face the fallout of</font></b> working with Goldman.In 2009, Goldman's<b><font color='green'> profits</font></b> soared to a remarkable $12 billion, just a year after it<b><font color='red'> was bailed</font></b> out along with the rest of Wall Street during the financial crisis.Much of the firm's profit was generated from trading;<b><font color='green'> extremely low interest rates</font></b> maintained by the Federal Reserve and the government's policy of<b><font color='red'> considering big " systemically important " companies like Goldman â € ˜ Too Big To Fail â € ™</font></b><b><font color='lime'> contributed to an extremely favorable trading environment</font></b>.But during this time, Goldman's<b><font color='red'> image problems</font></b><b><font color='red'> suffered</font></b>.It was lampooned in a widely read  article as a giant "squid monster," and roundly criticized by politicians for its connection to government, which some say gave it an advantage over other firms like Lehman Brothers, which<b><font color='red'> was forced</font></b> to file for bankruptcy, while Goldman<b><font color='red'> was bailed</font></b> out.Comments from CEO Lloyd Blankfein didnâ€™t help either; he was quoted as saying that the firm was doing "God's work" when the firm buys and sells bonds, instigating more populist backlash.While<b><font color='red'> the bad publicity didn</font></b>â€™<b><font color='red'> t hurt traders</font></b>â€™ ability to make money, senior executives inside Goldman<b><font color='red'> worried about whether it</font></b> would<b><font color='red'> hurt bankers</font></b>â€™ ability to snare clients, particularly politically correct companies<b><font color='red'> worried about their own image</font></b>.In the past, Goldman's investment bank would snare most of<b><font color='green'> the high profile assignments</font></b>, though in recent months there<b><font color='red'> 's been some slippage with JPMorgan</font></b>  and Morgan Stanley winning key deals over Goldman.Now, the firm has lost the mother of all deals, from the most politically correct of clients, the US Treasury.Morgan will advise the Treasury on selling 7.7 billion shares that comprise its 27% ownership position in the firm that it took to support Citigroup during the financial crisis.The fees wonâ€™t be huge, according to people inside Morgan, but given the size of the deal the sale as first reported by FOX Business will begin this spring , Morgan will likely make a modest amount of money.Then there's the prestige value: Morgan will be able to tout its role in helping sell the largest equity offering in history.A spokesman for Goldman Sachs didnâ€™t return a call for comment on why the firm<b><font color='red'> lost</font></b> out, or if it<b><font color='red'> plans to rethink its media strategy amid the loss</font></b>.Personal Finance Investing Financial News Business News Stock Market Quotes & News Small Business
