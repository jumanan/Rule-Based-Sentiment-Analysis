Nokia (NOK) NewsBite - NOK Falls on Economic Worries
Posted: Thursday, March 11, 2010 9:46 AM EDT 
Nokia (NYSE: NOK) opened at $14.42. So far today, the stock has hit a low of $14.41 and a high of $14.44. NOK is now trading at $14.43, down $0.13 (-0.89%). Over the last 52 weeks the stock has ranged from a low of $9.96 to a high of $16.58. NOK shares are trading lower with the rest of the market this morning after a pair of disappointing economic reports reignited investors' fears of a sluggish economic recovery. The Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims fell less than expected last week, while the Chinese government reported a larger than expected increase in January consumer prices. The latter report could lead to the Chinese government withdrawing economic stimulus measures sooner than expected, which could slow down global economic growth. Technical indicators for the stock are bullish and S&P gives NOK a positive 4 STARS (out of 5) buy ranking. If you are looking for a hedged play on NOK the stock seems like it could be a candidate for a July out-of-the-money bear-call credit spread above the 17 range.
