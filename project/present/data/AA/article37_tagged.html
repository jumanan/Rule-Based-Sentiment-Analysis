NEW YORK Stocks rose Friday after European leaders agreed to a bailout program for debt burdened Greece.A report showing a small improvement in consumer sentiment also helped stocks.The better than expected report further solidified expectations that consumers are growing more comfortable about the economy.The Dow Jones industrial average is up about 51 points.At the same time, traders brushed off a slightly worse than expected revision to the nation's fourth quarter gross domestic product.The report confirmed that the economy still grew rapidly during the last three months of the year because of government stimulus measures and companies replenishing their inventories.U.S. investors welcomed a joint European Union and International Monetary Fund aid program that will help Greece and other European nations facing rising debt.Stocks pulled back from their highs on Thursday as concern grew that meetings between European leaders would not result in a rescue program.The deal reached late Thursday will not make money immediately available to Greece, but instead act more as a safety net.Greece or other countries that use the euro will be able to receive money if they cannot raise it on their own."It reinforces there will be a rescue and support for Greece," said Oliver Pursche, executive vice president at Gary Goldberg Financial Services."It lays the groundwork for future rescue packages."

Investors have worried that mounting debt problems in places like Greece, Portugal and Spain would spread to other countries and upend a nascent global economic recovery.Heavy debt loads in Greece and other European countries had been one of the few drags on an otherwise rising stock market in recent months.The reassurance that Greece will get aid, if necessary, helped the euro rise against the dollar, bouncing off 10 month lows seen earlier this week.Materials stocks, like Alcoa Inc. and United State Steel Corp., got a boost because of the weaker dollar.Financial shares also rose on receding European debt worries.In afternoon trading, the Dow rose 51.17, or 0.5 percent, to 10,892.38.The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 5.79, or 0.5 percent, to 1,171.52, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 9.23, or 0.4 percent, to 2,406.64.About two stocks rose for every one that fell on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 329.3 million shares, compared with 386 million traded at the same point Thursday.Investors appear to be brushing off a final update to GDP that showed the U.S. economy grew at a 5.6 percent pace in the fourth quarter.Subscribe to Rate this Commentary
