UPDATE 1 "Alice" stays atop box offices for third week
Sun Mar 21, 2010 2:48pm EDT
 Adds other films, details  |  LOS ANGELES, March 21 Reuters Disney 3 D adventure
"Alice in Wonderland" retained the top spot at North American
box offices for a third straight week, collecting $34.5 million
and beating three new films including romantic comedy "The
Bounty Hunter."
 "Diary of a Wimpy Kid," based on the first book in the
popular series by Jeff Kinney, claimed the No.2 spot with
$21.8 million as children and parents turned out in solid
numbers and pushed adult oriented "Bounty Hunter" to third with
$21 million, according to studio estimates on Sunday.Chris Aronson, senior vice president of domestic
distribution for "Wimpy Kid" studio 20th Century Fox, said
audiences were roughly evenly split between males and females
and more than 40 percent were over age 25, hinting that the
books' adult fans turned out in theaters, too."It's clearly a family movie, but the audience has been
broader than that," he said."I think we just found out how
deep the fan base is and how dear this series is," he said.The books, four so far with a fifth due on bookshelves this
year, trace the life of U.S. middle school student Gregory
Heffley and the funny things that happen to him in his daily
routine of classes, chores, friends, rivals and family."Bounty Hunter" touted major starpower with Gerard Butler
portraying a career criminal chaser whose new target is his
ex wife, portrayed by Jennifer Aniston, and it was widely
promoted heading into the weekend.Both "Wimpy Kid" and "Bounty Hunter" opened in just under
3,100 theaters, with the former earning about $7,100 per
location and the latter at just over $6,800 per venue.By contrast, Disney's "Alice" was playing in around 3,700
locations and pulled in roughly $9,300 per theater, pushing its
total domestic box office in three weeks to over $265 million.The Disney studio is a unit of Walt Disney Co  , and
Fox is a division of News Corp  ."Bounty Hunter" was
released by Columbia Pictures, a part of Sony Corp.The weekend's other new movie, science fiction adventure
"Repo Men" was a distant fourth with $6.2 million in another
disappointing opening for Universal Pictures, which last week
debuted Iraq war film "Green Zone" at No.2 behind "Alice."
 "Green Zone," starring Matt Damon, fell to No.6 this
weekend with ticket sales just under $6 million, giving the
big budget action flick a total of $24.7 million.Universal is
a unit of the NBC Universal media wing of General Electric Co
  It was narrowly beat to the No.5 spot by Paramount
Pictures' comedy "She's Out of My League," which claimed just
over $6 million.Paramount is a unit of Viacom Inc.Elsewhere, director Roman Polanski's thriller "The Ghost
Writer" continues to play well in a limited release in major
cities, earning about $2 million over the weekend, or $14,000
per theater in only 145 locations.Widely promoted "The Runaways," starring Kristen Stewart
and Dakota Fanning in the tale of an all girl band, mustered
$3,300 in 244 theaters for an unspectacular total of $804,000."The Runaways" was released by privately held Apparition
Films and "Ghost Writer" by closely held Summit Entertainment.Reporting by US SMALL/MIDCAPS Earnings, materials sector lift stocks
