US Stocks End Up Slightly, Extend Weekly Win Streak
 By Donna Kardos 
 (Updates with additional company information, beginning in the 11th paragraph.) 
 NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- U.S. stocks closed slightly higher Friday, led by materials stocks including Alcoa and such consumer-discretionary stocks as Walt Disney and McDonald's. 
 Stocks also closed in positive territory for the week, marking the fourth-straight week of gains, the longest weekly win streak since August. 
 The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9.15 points, or 0.08%, to 10850.36. For the week, it climbed 1.01%. The measure is now up 5.09% for the month and has climbed 4.05% for the year to date. 
 Alcoa was the Dow's best performer Friday with a gain of 16 cents, or 1.1%, to 14.27. However, Alcoa has been the Dow's worst performer this quarter. With just a few days left to the quarter, it is down some 13% for the year to date. The stock has been hit hard in recent months by concerns over how demand for materials could be impacted by tightening measures in China. 
 Among the Dow's other top components Friday, Walt Disney rose 22 cents, or 0.6%, to 35.31. McDonald's climbed 36 cents, or 0.5%, to 67.26. 
 Bank of America was also strong with a jump of 16 cents, or 0.9%, to 17.90. The stock has also been one of the Dow's best performers for the quarter, only topped by General Electric and Boeing. Bank of America is up 17% for the quarter so far, while GE has climbed 19% over the same period and Boeing has surged 31%. Boeing's surge came as investors have been betting on a resurgence in demand for aircraft. 
 The Nasdaq Composite slipped 2.28, or 0.10%, to 2395.13, giving back some of its gains from earlier in the week. The measure still ended in the black for the week with a gain of 0.87%. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500 edged up 0.86, or 0.07%, to 1166.59, with the materials and consumer-discretionary sectors leading to the upside, while its health-care and technology sectors weighed. It rose 0.58% this week, with the consumer-discretionary and financial sectors posting the biggest gains of the week while energy and utilities had the largest declines, hurt by a slump in crude prices. 
 Friday's action came as investors were encouraged after leaders of the 16-nation euro zone backed a deal under which they and the International Monetary Fund would jointly bail out Greece should the country's debt troubles intensify. However, the Commerce Department lowered its estimate of fourth-quarter economic growth. Investors also became concerned about the sinking of a South Korean naval ship near the border with North Korea. 
 "It's very much a market seeking direction," said Howard Ward, portfolio manager of the Gamco Growth Fund. On the positive said, he said, investors were relieved about the plan to help Greece. "But you can look at the negative revision to GDP and be upset about that, and you can wonder why the South Korea ship blew up," he added. "People are just grasping at straws here to come up with excuses to justify buying or selling. Nothing really seems to point in one direction or the other." 
 RadioShack jumped 1.85, or 8.5%, to 23.65, after the New York Post said the electronics retailer is considering a sale of the company that could fetch more than $3 billion. It said one potential buyer is Best Buy, which edged up 50 cents, or 1.2%, to 43.16. 
 Apple (Nasdaq) climbed 4.25, or 1.9%, to 230.90, after Credit Suisse made some bullish comments about the consumer-electronics company in a note to clients. "We believe Apple is now running well ahead of expectations in all of its key business segments during what is typically a seasonally 'sloppy' quarter," the firm wrote. The stock set a fresh all-time high during the session. 
 Genzyme (Nasdaq) advanced 1.87, or 3.7%, to 53. Leerink Swann raised its investment rating on the biotechnology company's stock to outperform from market perform, saying the market overreacted to news from earlier in the week that the company is likely to lose oversight of its main manufacturing operation under an FDA consent decree that usually lasts for five years. 
 American depositary shares of Nokia edged up 26 cents, or 1.7%, to 15.46, while Research In Motion (Nasdaq) rose 1.63, or 2.2%, to 75.06, after J.P. Morgan upgraded its investment ratings on the stock to overweight from neutral. With big growth in smart phones coming, prices have become more pliable, and J.P. Morgan said that bodes well for those who can compete on price. 
 Progressive climbed 68 cents, or 3.7%, to 19.27, after the stock received investment rating upgrades from J.P. Morgan and FBR Capital. The firms expect the insurer can underprice rivals in a stronger auto-insurance environment. 
 Seagate Technology (Nasdaq) fell 69 cents, or 3.5%, to 18.93, after BMO Capital Markets cut its investment rating on the stock to market perform from outperform and lowered its price target and estimates for the maker of hard disk drives and its rival Western Digital (WDC). Western Digital shares slipped 1.13, or 2.8%, to 39.55. BMO said channel checks have indicated pricing has been much more aggressive, which it expects to impact margins in June and subsequent months. 
 Urban Outfitters (Nasdaq) jumped 1.13, or 3.1%, to 37.98, after J.P. Morgan raised its investment rating on the retailer's stock to overweight from neutral. The company, which operates the Anthropologie and Free People brands as well as its namesake stores, has "many of the attributes that growth investors in our space look for," J.P. Morgan said, citing a differentiated brand portfolio, strong square-footage growth and opportunity for operating margins to grow. 
 Coach advanced 1.61, or 4.2%, to 40.31. J.P. Morgan boosted its investment rating on the leather-goods retailer's stock to overweight from neutral, saying it sees the company "as a margin-recovery story that, when compared to our specialty universe, has the most 'ways to win' in 2010."
