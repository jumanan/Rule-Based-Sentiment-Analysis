Trefis analysis is produced by a team of analysts who build detailed models for each company on the platform Trefis.com
 is trying to revive its declining US mobile phone business with new smart phones based on Nokiaâ€™s Symbian 3 operating system.The new phones will be released by June 2010 and could<b><font color='green'> lead to a 5 % boost in our</font></b> $25 Trefis price estimate for Nokiaâ€™s stock
.Â  The upside to our<b><font color='green'> forecast depends</font></b> on Nokiaâ€™s mobile phone market share in developed markets like the U.S. returning to 2005 levels as a result of demand for Symbian 3 phones.Attracting U.S. Consumers with Features and Pricing
Symbian 3, an<b><font color='green'> improved version of Nokia â € ™</font></b>s current Symbian operating system, will be specifically targeted at the US market.Â  Symbian 3 phones will have enhanced features like multi touch, fast flip scrolling and free navigation software that will make the new phones attractive to consumers in the US.In addition to<b><font color='green'> attracting consumers with advanced features</font></b>, the new Nokia phones are expected to appeal to price conscious consumers with<b><font color='green'> more attractive pricing</font></b> than the iPhone or BlackBerry.Â  The Nokia Nuron will be one of the first phones on Symbian 3 that will be sold in the US.Â  It will be priced at $70 with a two year contract with T Mobile and $180 without any service contract.Potential 5% Upside to Trefis Price for Nokia
We currently forecast that Nokiaâ€™s market share in developed markets
 US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, etc. will decline from 27% in 2009 to 23% by the end of Trefis forecast period due to increasing competition from Apple and RIM.We estimate that Nokiaâ€™s mobile phone business in developed markets constitutes only about 23% of the stockâ€™s value.Â  In comparison, the mobile phone business in emerging markets accounts for about 70% of Nokiaâ€™s value.Â  The significance of the companyâ€™s mobile phones business in emerging markets<b><font color='red'> has a limiting impact on</font></b> how much Nokiaâ€™<b><font color='green'> s stock benefits from improvements in Nokia sales in the US</font></b>.modifying our forecast for Nokia market share
, you can see how there would be a $1.30 5% upside to our $25 Trefis price estimate for Nokiaâ€™s stock
 if the companyâ€™s market share in developed markets were to return to past levels of around 30% as a result of Nokiaâ€™s new Symbian 3 based phones.For additional analysis and forecasts, here is our complete model for Nokiaâ€™s stock
