 By MarketWatch  BOSTON MarketWatch U.S. financial stocks closed up slightly Monday with Citigroup Inc. shares<b><font color='red'> offsetting losses by E Trade Financial Corp.</font></b> and American International Group Inc. following an analyst upgrade of Citi./quotes/comstock/13*!c
</br>
 shares closed up 4% following an upgrade by Rochdale Research, which lifted the stock to buy from neutral, and increased the price target to $5 from $3.75 a share.Citi, which received a government bailout during the credit crunch, will be a "money making machine again and the stock is long term chief," wrote Rochdale analyst Richard Bove in a research note."The economy is turning around.This means an improving loan loss situation," he added."The company's balance sheet has too much liquidity and it is over capitalized.This gives management the flexibility to offload the problem operations and to support longer term growth."  E Trade Financial Corp. shares<b><font color='red'> closed lower after the online broker</font></b> named a Citi veteran as its new CEO and announced a 1 for 10 reverse stock split.Shares of E Trade /quotes/comstock/15*!etfc

, closed up half a point.E Trade said its board has named Steven Freiberg as CEO, effective April 1.Freiberg, 53, has worked at Citi for three decades and<b><font color='green'> succeeds Robert Druskin</font></b>, who will stay on as E Trade's chairman, according to a news release./quotes/comstock/15*!etfc
</br>
 "With 2009's successful recapitalization behind us, our permanent CEO in place on April 1, and a focus on returning to sustained profitability, we believe a reverse stock split is a logical next step for the company as we complete our financial and managerial restructuring," Druskin said in a prepared statement.E Trade's banking operations have been hit by loan losses during the credit crunch and housing downturn.In the core brokerage business, the firm recently cut commissions after rivals such as Charles Schwab Corp. /quotes/comstock/13*!schw
</br>
 and Fidelity Investments announced fee reductions and sparked a price war.In late January, E Trade said its fourth quarter net loss narrowed to $67 million from $276 million in the year ago quarter.It set aside nearly $300 million to cover potential loan losses in the fourth quarter.Week ahead in markets
