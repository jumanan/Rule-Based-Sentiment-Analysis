TOKYO: Walt Disney World in Florida may be the next stop for bullet train makers in Japan and China.Central Japan Railway Co. and China South Locomotive & Rolling Stock Corp. are competing for the $8bn President Barack Obama granted for 13 high speed corridors across the United States, including a Tampa Orlando line that may include a station at the Walt Disney resort in Orlando.The Japanese company, also known as JR Central, is eyeing North America as a shrinking population at home limits its growth.France&rsquo;s Alstom, Germany&rsquo;s Siemens and Canada&rsquo;s Bombardier also want to sell trains, tracks and operating equipment under an initiative that Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood called &ldquo;an absolute game changer for American transportation.&rdquo; The high speed corridors include New York Buffalo, New York; Los Angeles San Francisco; and Chicago Detroit.&ldquo;High speed rail is going to be a big industry in the US,&rdquo; said Masayuki Kubota, who oversees the equivalent of $1.8bn in assets at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo.&ldquo;A lot of companies are going to try and get a piece of the action.&rdquo; Bullet trains are generally considered to be those traveling faster than 180 mph.Japan is home to the world&rsquo;s first &ldquo;shinkansen&rdquo; and the biggest high speed network, carrying 308 million people in the 12 months through March 2009.JR Central runs Japan&rsquo;s busiest bullet train line.By comparison, Amtrak&rsquo;s Acela Express, which can reach 150 mph between Washington and Boston, carried 3.4 million passengers in fiscal 2008.Amtrak, which received $112m of the Obama package to upgrade its Northeast Corridor, uses trains from Alstom and Bombardier, the world&rsquo;s biggest maker of passenger locomotives.Nagoya based JR Central is working with US Japan High Speed Rail, backed by Washington based New Magellan Ventures, to sell its train systems in North America.&ldquo;Florida is at the top of our list,&rdquo; JR Central Chairman Yoshiyuki Kasai said.&ldquo;Our marketing partners in the U.S. have been in close contact with the routes we have targeted.&rdquo; Those include Texas and a line between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, he said.JR Central controls Japan&rsquo;s largest maker of bullet trains, Nippon Sharyo and showcased its trains to representatives from US high speed rail groups and embassies in November.Its N700 model accelerated to 205 mph within minutes of leaving a station in western Japan.&ldquo;It was probably the smoothest high speed train I&rsquo;ve been on,&rdquo; Robert Eckels, chairman of the Texas High Speed Rail & Transportation Corp., said as he stood on the platform after the midnight run.The not for profit corporation aims to link San Antonio, Dallas Fort Worth, and Houston by 2020.JR Central isn&rsquo;t the only Japanese trainmaker seeking to boost exports.Kawasaki Heavy Industries of Kobe made the trains for Taiwan&rsquo;s $15bn high speed line that started operating three years ago between suburban Taipei and Kaohsiung in the south.Hitachi of Tokyo made high speed trains that run from London&rsquo;s northern suburbs to the financial district.More than 50 countries already use trains or rail parts made in China, which has three high speed rail lines and plans to connect all provincial capitals and cities with more than 500,000 citizens by 2020, the Ministry of Railways said.State owned China South Locomotive and China CNR Corp. signed overseas contracts worth a combined $2.3bn last year, according to their annual reports.The sales included switches to the US and 20 locomotives to New Zealand.&ldquo;China&rsquo;s rail parts and trains at least have advantage in price,&rdquo; said Han Weiqi, an analyst for CSC International Holdings Ltd. in Shanghai.&ldquo;Chinese trainmakers want to go abroad because they want to sell the products at higher profit margin.&rdquo; General Electric, the world&rsquo;s biggest maker of freight locomotives, announced a partnership with China&rsquo;s Ministry of Railways in November to manufacture equipment for US high speed rail projects.Shao Renqiang, board secretary for China South Locomotive, said the company will &ldquo;actively&rdquo; participate in US railway construction.&ldquo;The Europeans and other Asian competitors are all eyeing the U.S. market,&rdquo; said Michael Finnegan, an executive vice president at US Japan High Speed Rail.&ldquo;The competition will be fierce.&rdquo; Deficit figure has Greece in more trouble
