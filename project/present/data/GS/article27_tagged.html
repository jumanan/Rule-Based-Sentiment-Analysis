 Adds share gain in second paragraph.By Terrence Dopp and Matthew Leising
</br>
 March 23 Bloomberg Former New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine, who ran Goldman Sachs Group Inc. from 1994 to 1999, has accepted offers to lead the futures and options broker MF Global Holdings Ltd. and<b><font color='lime'> become an operating partner of buyout firm J.C. Flowers</font></b> & Co.
</br>
 Corzine, 63, becomes chairman and chief executive officer immediately, MF Global said in a statement today.He takes over from Bernard W. Dan, 50, who is leaving for personal reasons and will stay until May 16 to aid in Corzine&rsquo;s transition, the New York based company said.MF Global shares gained as much as 13 percent in after market trading.The former Goldman Sachs chief said MF Global&rsquo;s plans to become a primary dealer in government securities are a major part of his strategy to increase revenue.He will be paid an initial salary of $1.5 million and a $1.5 million signing bonus, the company said today in a regulatory filing.&ldquo;A lot of the strategic possibilities with MF Global are really exciting and this gets to my desire to play in a more entrepreneurial environment,&rdquo; Corzine said in a conference call today.At the same time, &ldquo;we have some challenges.I don&rsquo;t think anyone here is happy with the earnings profile.&rdquo;
</br>
 Corzine, a Democrat, was defeated in the November election by Republican Chris Christie, 47, amid voter anger over the state&rsquo;s finances and the U.S. recession.Corzine had said he was interested in returning to Wall Street after leaving office.Many Choices
</br>
 &ldquo;He had more choices than people have fingers and toes,&rdquo; said Orin Kramer, general partner of Boston Provident Partners LP and the chairman of the council that oversees New Jersey&rsquo;s $67 billion pension fund.&ldquo;Since the election, what he&rsquo;s really wanted is to have an operating base that he could turn into a significant financial services firm,&rdquo; Kramer said.&ldquo;He knows that he has to build a serious, profitable business.&rdquo;
</br>
 J.C. Flowers, headed by former Goldman Sachs banker Christopher Flowers, announced Corzine&rsquo;s appointment today in a statement.The firm recommended Corzine for the position, spokeswoman Marcia Horowitz said in the statement.It controls two seats on MF Global&rsquo;s nine member board.In October 2007, Corzine called Flowers &ldquo;an extraordinary investor&rdquo; who helps oversee some of his investments.J.C. Flowers invested as much as $300 million in MF Global in May 2008.&lsquo;Earnings Profile&rsquo;
</br>
 MF Global, the former brokerage unit of London based Man Group Plc, provides execution and clearing services for exchange traded and over the counter derivatives and foreign exchange products.The firm has lost more than 76 percent of its value since its stock reached $31.47 at the end of 2007.MF Global expects net revenue in the current quarter to be $235 million to $245 million, the company said today.It hadn&rsquo;t provided prior guidance, spokesman Jeremy Skule said.Net revenue, which excludes interest and transaction based expenses, was $251 million last quarter.Its capital and cash positions shouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;materially different&rdquo; than on Dec. 31, the company said today.Corzine has a target bonus of $3 million for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011, with a minimum of $2 million if individual and company goals are met, the company said.He was awarded a stock option to buy 2.5 million MF Global shares equal to the closing price on April 7 this year, according to the company.The Illinois born son of a farmer and schoolteacher, Corzine graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in 1969 and received his master&rsquo;s degree in business administration from the University of Chicago in 1973.Goldman Bond Trader
</br>
 Corzine moved to New Jersey after he was recruited to be a bond trader in 1975 by New York based Goldman.He became chairman and CEO in 1994 and left in 1999 as the firm went public.Corzine was elected to the U.S. Senate the following year and became governor in 2006.MF Global became a public company in 2007 and soon saw its shares plunge after questions arose over its risk management practices.The stock fell 45 percent in two days in February 2008 after the company disclosed that a broker lost $141 million on what it said were unauthorized wheat futures trades.MF Global lost more than 90 percent of its value in 2008 after earnings fell short of forecasts and amid confusion over financing deals that were done to repay debt.The chief executive at the time, Kevin Davis, resigned in October 2008 and Dan, the former CEO of the Chicago Board of Trade, took over.Risk Management
</br>
 &ldquo;We need to make our capital structure more secure over time,&rdquo; Corzine said today.He hasn&rsquo;t had a chance to evaluate MF Global&rsquo;s risk management systems, though that is part of his short term plan to become familiar with the company, he said.MF Global will also look to become involved in more transactions where, instead of brokering a transaction, it holds one side of a trade.To become a primary dealer, for example, it would have to buy government securities with its own funds to then sell to customers.Since entering politics, Corzine has spent more than $130 million of his own money seeking office, according to state and federal election records.Divorced in 2003, Corzine currently lives in Hoboken, New Jersey, and has three grown children.During his first year as governor, Corzine ordered a weeklong government shutdown after lawmakers in his own party resisted his calls to increase the sales tax to help close a budget deficit.Legislators later passed Corzine&rsquo;s $1.1 billion sales tax increase after he agreed to a compromise that dedicated half the proceeds to reducing New Jersey&rsquo;s highest in the nation property taxes.Corzine spent more than two weeks in a Camden hospital in 2007 after the State Police driven sport utility vehicle in which he was riding without a seatbelt crashed into a guard rail along the Garden State Parkway.He sustained a broken thigh bone, sternum and 12 ribs in the collision, which happened as the vehicle was travelling 91 miles per hour 147 kph .Also today, Princeton University appointed Corzine as its John L. Weinberg/Goldman Sachs & Co. visiting professor in its Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.With assistance by Christine Harper.Editors: Stacie Servetah, Mark Tannenbaum
