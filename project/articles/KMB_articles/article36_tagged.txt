Kimberly Clark Introduces Kleenex Hand Towels
Innovative Solution Offers Convenient, Hygienic Alternative to Cloth Bathroom Hand Towels
DALLAS &#8211; Kimberly Clark Corporation NYSE:KMB today announced the national launch of Kleenex Hand Towels &#8211; an innovative solution that delivers one clean, fresh, dry towel every time consumers wash their hands in the home bathroom.The single use, disposable bathroom hand towel from the Kleenex brand provides consumers a unique new product that addresses consumers&#8217; growing concern with hand hygiene and is a means to help maintain their families&#8217; health and wellness.In the U.S. alone, people dry their hands on cloth bathroom towels approximately 200 billion times per year.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC guidelines for hand washing recommends hand drying with a single use towel, but consumers have not had a practical alternative to traditional cloth hand towels in their home bathrooms &#8211; until now.Kleenex Hand Towels are designed to address this unmet need.The product&#8217;s unique, Cottony Soft base sheet is free of inks, dyes and fragrances and highly absorbent &#8211; drying hands effectively, with enough capacity in the brand&#8217;s proprietary, absorbent Dry Touch fibers for secondary quick clean ups around the bathroom sink.Kleenex Hand Towels&#8217; flexible packaging complements bathroom décor and space limitations, allowing the product to be placed on a towel bar or countertop.The Pop Up delivery system always keeps one clean, fresh, dry towel conveniently at hand.&#8220;Consumers know that even after they are washed, hands are only as clean as the towel used to dry them,&#8221; said Gordon Knapp, president, Kimberly Clark North Atlantic Family Care.&#8220;Kleenex Hand Towels are a first of its kind solution that leverages K C&#8217;s and the Kleenex brand&#8217;s strengths in translating consumer insights into product design and technology to offer a real alternative to less hygienic, shared bathroom cloth hand towels.&#8220;The Kleenex brand created the facial tissue category more than 80 years ago by offering consumers a replacement for cloth handkerchiefs.Building on that legacy the brand is now delivering an alternative solution to cloth bathroom hand towels with Kleenex Hand Towels.This new solution represents genuine innovation and a solid growth opportunity for the brand, K C and our retail customers.&#8221;
Kleenex Hand Towels performed well in preliminary testing with consumers.Approximately two thirds said they would use Kleenex Hand Towels as a substitute for cloth towels, and more than 90 percent reacted favorably to how the product and package design looked in their bathrooms.&#8220;Based on early consumer feedback, we believe Kleenex Hand Towels will receive a positive reception from moms who are germ conscious, appreciate the convenience of disposable paper products, and make a clean and orderly bathroom a top cleaning priority,&#8221; said Ann Vanevenhoven, Kleenex senior brand manager.&#8220;In January, we tested consumer reception of the new Kleenex brand product by debuting it on the QVC shopping channel.During its first seven minutes of being on air, we sold approximately 3,000 cases of Kleenex Hand Towels.A second airing yielded an additional 4,200 cases.By the time we complete this program we anticipate a total of 14,800 cases being sold on the QVC channel,&#8221; said Vanevenhoven.K C plans to raise national consumer awareness and trial of the new Kleenex Hand Towels this Spring with an integrated marketing program that includes print and TV advertising, direct to consumer online communications and blogging outreach, sampling, FSIs, experiential marketing and public relations activities.Kleenex Hand Towels will be widely available at major U.S. retail locations in March at a suggested manufacturer&#8217;s retail price of approximately $3.00 for a box of 60 towels.About the Kleenex Brand
