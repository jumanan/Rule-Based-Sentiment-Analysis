ANF &ndash; Abercrombie & Fitch Co.  Shares of the teen/tween fashion retailer surrendered 2.45% of their value during the first hours of the trading session to stand at $46.42 despite reports the firm posted a 5% year to date increase in same store sales in March.One bullish options investor took advantage of the current share price erosion by initiating a debit call spread to position for a rebound in shares by November expiration.The optimistic trader purchased 1,000 calls at the November $50 strike for an average premium of $3.58 each, and sold the same number of calls at the higher November $60 strike for $1.14 apiece.Net premium paid for the spread amounts to $2.44 per contract.Thus, the investor stands ready to accumulate maximum potential profits of $7.56 per contract should ANF&rsquo;s shares surge 29.25% from the current price through $60.00 ahead of expiration day in about eight months time.The call spreader starts to make money as long as Abercrombie&rsquo;s shares increase at least 12.95% to surpass the effective breakeven price of $52.44 by November expiration.BBBY &ndash; Bed Bath & Beyond, Inc.The home furnishings retailer&rsquo;s shares are up more than 3.50% in the first half of the trading day to secure a new 52 week high of $46.44 after reporting better than expected fourth quarter earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday.BBBY posted earnings per share of $0.86 for the quarter, which trumped average analyst expectations of $0.73 per share.The earnings surprise prompted analysts at Barclays to up their target share price on BBBY to $47.00 from $44.00, while analysts at UBS increased their target share price for the firm to $55.00.The new 52 week high for Bed Bath & Beyond inspired on options player to lock in the rally in shares by initiating a ratio put spread in the May contract.The investor purchased 2,500 puts at the May $46 strike for an average premium of $1.60 apiece, spread against the sale of 5,000 puts at the lower May $44 strike for $0.80 each.The trader put on the spread for free because of the greater proportion of sold puts at the lower strike price.Therefore, the investor &ndash; who is likely holding a long position in the underlying shares &ndash; is protected in case BBBY&rsquo;s shares slip beneath $46.00 ahead of expiration day in May.Of course, it is possible the investor does not own the stock, in which case he is positioned to amass maximum potential profits to the downside of $2.00 per contract should shares decline to $44.00 by expiration next month.Note: The material presented in this commentary is provided for informational purposes only and is based upon information that is considered to be reliable.However, neither Interactive Brokers LLC nor its affiliates warrant its completeness, accuracy or adequacy and it should not be relied upon as such.Neither IB nor its affiliates are responsible for any errors or omissions or for results obtained from the use of this information.Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.This material is not intended as an offer or solicitation for the purchase or sale of any security or other financial instrument.Securities or other financial instruments mentioned in this material are not suitable for all investors.Any opinions expressed herein are given in good faith, are subject to change without notice, and are only correct as of the stated date of their issue.The information contained herein does not constitute advice on the tax consequences of making any particular investment decision.This material does not take into account your particular investment objectives, financial situations or needs and is not intended as a recommendation to you of any particular securities, financial instruments or strategies.Before investing, you should consider whether it is suitable for your particular circumstances and, as necessary, seek professional advice.| View more articles by Register for Our Free Newsletter and Become an Insider Today!Enter your email address below:
