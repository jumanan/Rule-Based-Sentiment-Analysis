NYSE:  as the Bull of the Day and Sunoco, Inc. NYSE:  the Bear of the Day.In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Santarus Inc. Nasdaq:  , Merck NYSE:  and GlaxoSmithKline NYSE: Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: Bull of the Day: Tiffany & Co. NYSE: TIF is well positioned to deliver robust sales and earnings growth by leveraging capital investments made in the past several years.The company holds a significant position in the world jewelry market and is poised to benefit from its enhanced geographic reach.With signs of improvement in retail environment, Tiffany boosts its store expansion program.The company has also been concentrating more on smaller size store formats that offer selected collections of lower priced higher margin products.Moreover, with a healthy balance sheet, Tiffany remains committed to achieve long term objectives of at least a 15% return on equity and a 10% return on assets.Bear of the Day: We have downgraded Sunoco, Inc. NYSE: SUN shares to Underperform from Neutral, reflecting the bearish refining margin outlook.Weak demand for refined products in the global downturn and increased capacity has squeezed margins throughout the industry.Rising crude oil prices have added to Sunoco's miseries by increasing the cost of production.With utilization rates remaining at historically low levels, we see a fairly unfavorable macro backdrop for independent refiners over the coming 6 12 months.Sunoco's lack of geographic diversification and refining flexibility has also become a major liability, in our view.Given these headwinds, we expect Sunoco shares to be under pressure in the near future.Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: Santarus OTC Drug Launched Santarus Inc. Nasdaq: SNTS recently announced the launch of the over the counter OTC version of its flagship product, Zegerid.OTC Zegerid is being promoted in North America by Merck's NYSE: MRK consumer health care subsidiary, Schering Plough HealthCare Products Inc.The product gained approval from the US Food and Drug Administration FDA on December 1, 2009.The OTC version has been developed under Santarus' agreement with Merck whereby Merck<b><font color='green'> gained exclusive rights for the development</font></b>, manufacture and sale of Zegerid OTC products in the US and Canada.The OTC version received approval from the FDA for OTC treatment of frequent heartburn.Zegerid is Santarus' lead product.Santarus markets the Zegerid family of products, which are proprietary immediate release formulations that combine omeprazole Prilosec , a PPI, and one or more antacids.Zegerid is approved by the FDA for the treatment or reduction of the risk of several upper gastrointestinal diseases and disorders.It is already marketed as capsule and powder for oral suspension dosage forms.The launch of the OTC version is a major positive for Santarus.Over and above a $20 million milestone payment received from Merck, Santarus could also receive up to $37.5 million in sales milestone payments along with low double digit royalty on net sales.Santarus should start recognizing royalty revenues from the first quarter of 2010.In addition to ensuring a steady source of revenue for Santarus in the form of milestone payments and royalties on sales, the launch of the OTC version in the $1.8 billion OTC market will also help increase awareness of the Zegerid brand of products.We currently have a Neutral recommendation on Santarus.Zegerid has captured a nice share of the gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD market, and the company has good upside potential with the product through partnerships with GlaxoSmithKline NYSE: GSK , Norgine and Merck.Get the full analysis of all these stocks by going to http://at.zacks.com/?id=2649.About the Bull and Bear of the Day Every day, the analysts at Zacks Equity Research select two stocks that are likely to outperform Bull or underperform Bear the markets over the next 3 6 months.About the Analyst Blog Updated throughout every trading day, the Analyst Blog provides analysis from Zacks Equity Research about the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets.About Zacks Equity Research Zacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long term.Continuous analyst coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.Our analysts are organized by industry which gives them keen insights to developments that affect company profits and stock performance.Recommendations and target prices are six month time horizons.Zacks "Profit from the Pros" e mail newsletter provides highlights of the latest analysis from Zacks Equity Research.Subscribe to this free newsletter today by visiting http://at.zacks.com/?id=2677.Zacks.com is a property of Zacks Investment Research, Inc., which was formed in 1978 by Leonard Zacks.As a PhD in mathematics Len knew he could find patterns in stock market data that would lead to superior investment results.Amongst his many accomplishments was the formation of his proprietary stock picking system;
