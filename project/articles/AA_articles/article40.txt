Alcoa (AA) Rises on Bernanke's Comments
Posted: Thursday, March 25, 2010 11:00 AM EDT 
Alcoa (NYSE: AA) opened at $14.50. So far today, the stock has hit a low of $14.45 and a high of $14.67. AA is now trading at $14.58, up $0.26 (1.82%). Over the last 52 weeks the stock has ranged from a low of $6.60 to a high of $17.60. AA shares are on the move this morning after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke reiterated his opinion that record low interest rates are still needed to support the U.S. economy in Congressional testimony. Technical indicators for the stock are neutral and S&P gives AA a neutral 3 STARS (out of 5) hold ranking. If you are looking for a hedged play on AA the stock seems like it could be a candidate for a May out-of-the-money bull-put credit spread below the 13 range.
