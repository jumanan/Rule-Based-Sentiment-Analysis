Disney<b><font color='green'> eyes happy 2010 Company</font></b> expects acquisition of Marvel and other factors to equal strong season.Last Updated Tuesday, March 16, 2010 10:06 PM PDT

The Walt Disney Co. and its employees could<b><font color='green'> be in for a strong year</font></b>, as the Burbank media giant plans to release sequels for two juggernaut franchises and anticipates economic recovery to help it rebound from disappointing results in 2009, experts said.Disney, he said, is looking forward to<b><font color='green'> strong performances</font></b> from &ldquo;Toy Story 3&rdquo; and &ldquo;Iron Man 2,&rdquo; which recently came under the company&rsquo;s ownership after it bought Marvel Entertainment in 2009.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very<b><font color='green'> impressed with the Disney management,&rdquo</font></b>; said Jason Squire, a professor at the USC School of Cinematic Arts and former executive at 20th Century Fox.&ldquo;I think Bob Iger<b><font color='green'> is really ahead of the game</font></b>, and I have every confidence that his overall slate of theatrical, plus everything else that Disney is involved in, is going to<b><font color='green'> generate strong returns.&rdquo</font></b>;
</br>
Still, Disney executives decided that new investments would be key in helping the studio grow, Iger said.The company&rsquo;s $4 billion acquisition of Marvel was a major part of that effort, giving the studio an extensive archive of potential projects that could become major revenue generators, experts said.&ldquo;You have a very successful movie in &lsquo;The Proposal,&rsquo; but it didn&rsquo;t really call for a sequel,&rdquo; Kyser said.&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t really offer opportunities for merchandise or rides at the theme park, so what they&rsquo;re trying to do is come up with films that they can sell across all of their divisions.&rdquo;
</br>
The strong slate of upcoming potential money making ventures, including a fourth installment of the &ldquo;Pirates of the Caribbean&rdquo; due out in 2011, sparked optimism about possible job growth after a year of uncertainty in the heavily rooted local entertainment industry, experts said.Unemployment rises locally
