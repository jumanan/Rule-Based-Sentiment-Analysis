Stock News on Rising Drug Stocks (MRK, ALKS, ISIS, MYGN, MBRK)
, March 15, 2010 ) Dallas, Tx - Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) rose 0.38% to $37.30 after the company and Portola Pharmaceuticals announced the results of EXPLORE-Xa, a Phase 2 exploratory, dose finding study of betrixaban, an investigational oral direct Factor Xa inhibitor. Results showed that a once-daily dose of oral betrixaban, given to patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and at least one risk factor for stroke, reduced the incidence of major and clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeds compared to dose-adjusted warfarin. In this multinational, dose-finding study of 508 patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and at least one risk factor for stroke, a once daily dose of betrixaban 40 mg (n=127) demonstrated significantly less major and CRNM bleeding than open label warfarin (n=127, p=0.035). The risk of major and CRNM bleeding for the 60 mg (n=127) and 80 mg (n=127) doses of betrixaban was similar to warfarin.

All of those observations have been addressed.

Patients treated with mipomersen had a 25% LDL-C reduction in an intent-to-treat analysis. In addition to meeting its primary endpoint, the trial also met each of its secondary and tertiary endpoints, which included statistically significant reductions in apolipoprotein-B, total cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, Lp(a), VLDL-C and triglycerides.
