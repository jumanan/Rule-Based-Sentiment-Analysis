Goldman Sachs, Detroit, Junk Bonds & RoboCop
</br>
Well, if you like high yield or junk municipal bonds, then Goldman Sachs and Detroit have a deal for you.  They are selling municipal bonds at enticing yields.  I don&#8217;t know the exact yield on these bonds, but existing bonds issued by Detroit yield well north of 7%, four hundred basis points or more above the yield on a high quality municipal bond.The real City of Detroit seems, more and more, to resemble the fictional Detroit depicted in the 1987 movie, RoboCop more on this in a bit .Why are the yields so high on these Detroit bonds?As you can imagine, there are some unusual aspects of this deal, one of which is that Detroit may be forced into bankruptcy.  And, the new mayor wants to demolish 25% of the buildings in the city.  Oh, and the bond offering documents do not include a rather important piece of information, a report on the city&#8217;s financial condition.  Or, actually they include a financial report, but it&#8217;s based on information from 2008.This Bloomberg piece gives the details [emphasis added]:

Detroit Sells $250 Million Without Recent Disclosure Filings
</br>
 Bloomberg, Mar.11, 2010, Darrell Preston Detroit, the largest U.S. city whose debt is rated below investment grade, will ask investors today to buy $250 million of its debt without having filed annual financial reports on time for five years.The city, which warned investors in its preliminary official statement of the possibility of filing for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection, is providing a June 30, 2008, financial statement, its most recent, to investors.A fiscal 2009 report is expected to be complete by May 31, said city spokesman Dan Lijana, in an e mail.“This issue is not for the faint of heart,” said Richard Ciccarone

&#8230;Detroit is selling $250 million of bonds through investment banks led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to<b><font color='red'> help cover budget deficits</font></b> expected to total $280 million this year.The deal will probably appeal to investors seeking high yield municipal debt, predicted Ciccarone, precluding the city from a market with tax exempt yields near three month lows.&#8230;Detroit general obligations maturing in 2024 traded yesterday at a yield of according to Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board data.That compares with yields of 3.36 percent to 3.5 percent for top rated 14 year municipal debt

For those who have not been paying attention to Detroit&#8217;s travails of late, there has not been much good news.  The previous mayor, Kwame Kilpatrick, resigned in disgrace following a series of scandals.Numerous other city officials have been convicted on a variety of corruption charges, including Detroit City Council member, Monica Conyers, who just received a jail sentence of 37 months for a bribery conviction.  Conyers is the wife of U.S.Congressman John Conyers D MI .Perhaps the only bright spot is new Mayor Dave Bing.  Bing is a former star professional basketball player, who was named one of the NBA&#8217;s top 50 players in 1996.  He then went on to build a successful business career and he recently became mayor in a special election following Mayor Kilpatrick&#8217;s resignation.On his blog, Ed Driscoll this surprising twist:
</br>
Mayor Bing recently made news by stating that the city, facing $300 million in deficits and an unemployment rate approaching 50%, can no longer afford to patrol the city
</br>
bulldoze roughly a quarter of the buildings.Let&#8217;s see&#8230;can no longer afford to patrol the city.  Hmmm.Bulldozing a quarter of the city&#8217;s structure?  Uprooting residents?  Urban farming&#8230;?This is starting to sound a little too much like , the 1987 hit movie about a horribly dysfunctional fictional city named, well, Detroit.I suspect that Detroit is exploring the outer reaches of credibility in the municipal bond market at this point.  There may be worse credit risks among major U.S. cities, but I really cannot think of what they might be.I have not purchased an individual municipal bond in many years and I don&#8217;t plan to start with this one.  If I were a muni bond fund manager, I might take a look at these, but I wouldn&#8217;t put a lot of the portfolio&#8217;s eggs in that basket.I grew up in Michigan and I can remember Detroit as a pretty vibrant city, but all that is just a memory.Now, Detroit and Mayor are facing a grim reality.  I hope Dave Bing can bring new life to this city and, if anyone can do so, I believe he&#8217;s the one.Fundmastery Blog HOME PAGE
