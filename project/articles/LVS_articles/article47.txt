SmarTrend&apos;s candlestick pattern scanner has detected a bullish harami candle pattern for shares of Las Vegas Sands (

Friday&apos;s real body is within the previous day&apos;s body and may imply that traders and investors believe that the recent move lower is exhausted.

A green candle today would confirm this trend reversal. Also, the narrower the green real body yesterday, the more reliable the harami.

Friday, this company traded 53,789,620 shares, versus the previous day&apos;s total volume of 43,107,550. Decreased volume also is an indicator that the selling pressure may have subsided.

SmarTrend issued an Uptrend alert on shares of Las Vegas Sands on November 11, 2009 at $17.51 per share (25% return since that call). This bullish candle pattern may point to a continuation of the previously called Uptrend.
