 Nokia to get Snapdragon processor?
 Posted on Mar 17, 10 09:51 PM PDT 
There is a very real possibility of seeing a 1GHz Snapdragon processor inside a Nokia handset, thanks to one of Nokia's top executives, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo. According to him, &ldquo;Qualcomm definitely is a potential partner going forward. The companies did fight a long time in court, and now we see them as a potential partner.&rdquo; Now, the speedy Snapdragon processor is one of Qualcomm's great asset, so a similarly powered Nokia phone down the road should not be ruled out just yet.
