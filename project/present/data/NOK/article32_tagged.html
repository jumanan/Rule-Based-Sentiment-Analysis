, MarketWatch  SAN FRANCISCO MarketWatch In the fast growing market for smartphones, one broker prefers companies like Apple, Research In Motion and Nokia who are taking a "vertically<b><font color='green'> integrated</font></b>" approach to the business.In a report Friday morning, analysts at J.P. Morgan called 2010 "the year of the mobile computer." The brokerage predicted "mass market adoption" for smartphones that currently see high price elasticity, meaning that a decrease in pricing of a single percentage point leads to four point increase in unit sales.Because of the influx of new users, lead analyst Rod Hall believes companies that closely integrate hardware and software are in a better position to cash in on the growth.Almost Famous: Chris Messina of Google
</br>
 Almost Famous' Drake Martinet interviews Google's open Web advocate, Chris Messina, in a new "Need to Know" post."We believe that user experience complexity will grow and weigh in favor of those companies that can control and deliver superior integration through vertical integration of software and hardware," Hall wrote in his report.As such, Hall said he prefers vendors such as Apple /quotes/comstock/15*!aapl
</br>
, which makes the iPhone; Research In Motion /quotes/comstock/15*!rimm
</br>
, which makes the BlackBerry; and Nokia /quotes/comstock/13*!nok
</br>
.The latter two were upgraded to overweight, or buy, ratings.J.P. Morgan already rates Apple as overweight.Shares of Apple, Research In Motion and Nokia each closed higher Friday.Apple gained 1.9% to $230.90, while RIM gained 2.2% to $75.06 and Nokia added 1.7% to close at $15.46.Hall maintained a neutral view on Palm /quotes/comstock/15*!palm
</br>
, noting the company's recent troubles in selling its latest smartphones.He said the company's fate likely rests on introducing another hit product and improving its distribution.See recent story on Palm's struggles.RIM is scheduled to report its fourth quarter results next week.Wall Street expects the company to rack up double digit gains in both sales and earnings thanks to strong demand for its BlackBerry line.See Earnings Outlook on Research In Motion.Also, the brokerage started coverage of Motorola /quotes/comstock/13*!mot
</br>
 with a bearish underweight rating, noting that the company is relying on the Android operating system from Google /quotes/comstock/15*!goog
</br>
 for its latest phones putting it at a disadvantage to other vertically integrated rivals."We believe exposure to other companies more oriented toward MCs [mobile computers] is preferable," Hall wrote.Early PC comparisons  Hall compared the smartphone business to the early PC industry.In particular, he noted that "user experience stability is what ultimately drove the PC industry toward a horizontal, unintegrated structure which favored freestanding OS, hardware, and semiconductor vendors."  Users highly value things like location based services, battery life and push delivery, which give an advantage to companies that can closely integrate their software and hardware."We expect this unstable period to last for another 2 3 years before expected user experience stabilizes and a more horizontal industry emerges," he wrote.In this type of market, Hall says, Google's Android has a greater advantage in a horizontal market than a vertical one."We would caution investors against prematurely declaring Android as the winner as we expect the mobile computer OS platform market to be hotly contested over the next 2 3 years," Hall wrote.Hall also assumed coverage of Qualcomm /quotes/comstock/15*!qcom
</br>
 which makes chipsets and other technology for wireless handset makers.He rates the company as overweight, saying it is "well positioned to benefit from growth in smartphones given the strength of both its royalty and semiconductor businesses."  Qualcomm raised their fourth quarter forecast on Thursday.That, along with a bullish report from electronics retailer Best Buy, helped to propel trading across the tech sector as investors saw encouraging signs of consumer demand for tech products.See full story on consumer tech demand lifting stocks.Dan Gallagher is MarketWatch's technology editor, based in San Francisco.1 More The Ratings Game
