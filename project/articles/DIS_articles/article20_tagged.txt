VIACOM IS HAVING A BETTY WHITE MOMENT
The octogenarian actress has been in hot demand since appearing last summer in the movie The Proposal, bringing the house down at the Screen Actors Guild award ceremony in January, and stealing the show on Super Bowl Sunday in a Snickers candy bar commercial.She'll host Saturday Night Live on Mother's Day weekend.Just recently, the 88 year old White added to her streak of successes by signing on to star in Hot in Cleveland, a new situation comedy on Viacom's TV Land cable network.itself knows something about being rediscovered.After a long dry spell, investors are doing a double take when it comes to the entertainment company controlled by its executive chairman and founder, the savvy and tenacious media mogul Sumner Redstone, who turns 87 in May making him Betty White's junior by a year, it just so happens.After struggling through the wrenching slide for most media related stocks in the Great Recession, Viacom suffered the added indignity of seeing its shares pressured when Redstone was forced to sell a substantial amount of the stock as well as CBS stock to meet debt obligations of his National Amusements holding company in late 2008.But Viacom ended 2009 in much better shape than it was in when the year began.THE COMPANY'S BALANCE SHEET
 improved dramatically, and its operating free cash flow surged 17%, to $2 billion.The advertising climate stabilized.Two of its high profile cable networks, MTV and BET, staged big comebacks.Its movie studio, Paramount Pictures, streamlined its operations and had a string of blockbuster hits, including Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.Senior management has sworn off pursuing major acquisitions and made clear that, this year, it intends to discuss with its board ways to return capital to shareholders by reinstating a share repurchase program that was suspended in 2009 or by paying a dividend."As the world evolves, we are very well positioned," says CEO Philippe Dauman, a longtime confidante and former legal advisor of Redstone's.After a six year hiatus, Dauman returned to Viacom in 2006 to succeed Tom Freston, who'd fallen out of favor with the founder.Savvy investors have been drawn to Viacom because its shares remain sharply undervalued, belying its array of well known cable network brands, powerful cash flow, earnings growth potential and the possibility of a share buyback and/or perhaps a dividend payout, and operational stability, all amid a reviving economy.When compared with its peers, the stock is even more of a bargain.While it rebounded nicely in the past year, it still trails the PowerShares Dynamic Media Exchange Traded Fund
 , which represents the media and entertainment industry."The stock is extremely cheap," says Jerry Senser, chief investment officer of Chicago based Institutional Capital.Viacom is one of the money management firm's biggest positions.Broker Talk: Looking Beyond Goldman
