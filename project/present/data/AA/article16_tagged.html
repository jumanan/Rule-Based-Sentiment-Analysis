 * Closing Badin, Eastalco smelters
</br>
 |  |  |  * Sees $120 mln after tax charge
</br>
 * Sees $80 mln charge from U.S. health care overhaul Adds analyst's comment, background, additional details  HOUSTON, April 5 Reuters Alcoa Inc  said on
</br>
Monday it<b><font color='red'> plans to shut</font></b> and<b><font color='green'> demolish two previously idled plants</font></b>, citing market fundamentals.Alcoa will permanently shutter its Eastalco smelter in
</br>
Frederick, Maryland which has a capacity of 195,000
</br>
metric tons per year and its smelter in Badin, North Carolina
</br>
which has a capacity of 60,000 metric tons per year, it said in
</br>
a regulatory filing.Global demand for aluminum has not rebounded as quickly as
</br>
that of steel and other metals since the start of recession
</br>
started in December 2007.The price of the metal plunged 18 months ago from highs of
</br>
about $3,300 per tonne, and has slowly risen to around $2,300
</br>
on Monday.The Alcoa plant closures will result in an after tax charge
</br>
of $120 million in the first quarter, it said in a filing with
</br>
the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission."These smelters were not running," Affiliated Research
</br>
Group analyst Charles Bradford said."Eastalco, in particular,
</br>
was a situation where the power contract ran out."And it was a perfectly good smelter from an efficiency
</br>
standpoint and every other measure you would look at, except
</br>
that the power cost that was offered to them was just so high
</br>
that you could not justify running the plant," he added.The company also expects to record additional charges of
</br>
$10 million to $15 million for various costs related to the
</br>
demolitions from 2011 through 2015, it said.Bradford told Reuters the destruction of the two facilities
</br>
"won't affect the market, but it will affect Alcoa's<b><font color='red'> cost</font></b>."Because even if you are not operating the plant and don't
</br>
even have it on maintenance, it costs you for security," he
</br>
said.Alcoa will also take an $80 million charge in the first
</br>
quarter related to the U.S. healthcare overhaul signed into law
</br>
last month by President Barack Obama, it told regulators.Also on Monday, Alcoa said it<b><font color='green'> is increasing its investment in a</font></b> planned $10.8 billion aluminum complex in Saudi Arabia
</br>
after some of the U.S. company's partners in a consortium
</br>
dropped out [ID:nLDE6340JP].In a change in the ownership structure, Alcoa will now pay
</br>
about $1.1 billion over four years up from the $900 million it
</br>
had said in December.Reporting by  in Houston and Carole Vaporean in
