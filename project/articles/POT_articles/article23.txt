Potash (POT) Trading Near 52-Week High With 0.3% Dividend Yield And Support at 117.55
Posted: Tuesday, March 23, 2010 9:04 AM EDT 
Potash (NYSE: POT) ended the last trading session at $121.16. So far the stock has hit a 52-week low of $76.65 and 52-week high of $128.42. Potash stock has been showing support around 117.55 and resistance in the 125.65 range. Technical indicators for the stock are Bullish and S&P gives POT a neutral 3 STAR (out of 5) hold rating. POT appears on the Investors Observer Analysts Favorites list. For a hedged play on this stock, look at a Jun '10 120 covered call for a net debit in the $110.86 area. That is also the break even stock price for this trade. This covered call has an 89 day duration, provides 8.50% downside protection and an 8.24% assigned return rate for a 33.81% annualized return rate (comparison purposes only). A lower cost hedged play for this stock would use a longer term call option in place of the covered call stock purchase. To use this strategy look at going long the POT Jan '11 75 Call and selling the Jun '10 120 call for a $38.55 debit. The trade has an 89 day life and would provide 6.28% downside protection and a 16.73% assigned return rate for a 69.00% annualized return rate (for comparison purposes only). Potash has a current annual dividend yield of 0.32%. [ABR-Seven Summits Research]
