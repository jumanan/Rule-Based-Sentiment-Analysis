 McWilliams covers these topics and more in his recent reports:  Long before most people even realized there<b><font color='red'> was a recession underway</font></b>, McWilliams warned Next Inning readers in January 2008 that Intel would likely<b><font color='red'> drop to a low of</font></b> $12 before the year was done.However, shortly after that, McWilliams saw the recovery coming and believed that Intel would fully participate with its new processors.The price of Intel<b><font color='green'> has advanced 58 % since that call</font></b> to buy.While Wall Street analysts<b><font color='red'> missed Intel</font></b>'s<b><font color='green'> progress</font></b> in 2009 by an embarrassingly large margin, McWilliams was within a rounding error in his predictions for two out of the last three quarters and, in the other case, he was still closer than the analysts covering the stock.With that track record and<b><font color='green'> some nice profits</font></b> in the bank, what is his forecast revenue range for Intel's Q1 report?Is he<b><font color='green'> confident Intel</font></b> will<b><font color='green'> guide above Wall Street expectations for Q2</font></b>?What does he think will be the drivers for the first half of 2010 and what does he see as the biggest risks for the second half?AMD is up over 300% since it was listed in McWilliams special report, "Undervalued Tech Stocks for 2009," as a good speculative investment.What new strategy has AMD unveiled that McWilliams terms as "brilliant" and what trend does McWilliams think will give AMD confidence to guide above expectations for Q2?Why do McWilliams short and longer term outlooks for Nvidia differ so significantly?Does McWilliams think it's a good time for short term speculators to buy into the Nvidia story here or does he think there are better places to allocate funds today?What is brewing under the covers for Qualcomm that McWilliams thinks will give the stock a material boost in the second half?What is McWilliams target price for Qualcomm then?Cree is up 396% since McWilliams came "about as close as you'll ever see to pounding a table" in his recommendation that Next Inning members consider the stock when it dipped into the mid teens in late 2008.What four factors have driven McWilliams to extend his forward earnings forecast so far above Wall Street's, and what does he think investors should do now that Cree shares have continued to soar higher?Founded in September 2002, Next Inning's model portfolio has returned 273% since its inception versus 31% for the S&P 500.About Next Inning:  Next Inning is a subscription based investment newsletter that provides regular coverage on more than 150 technology and semiconductor stocks.Subscribers receive intra day analysis, commentary and recommendations, as well as access to monthly semiconductor sales analysis, regular Special Reports, and the Next Inning model portfolio.Editor Paul McWilliams is a 30+ year semiconductor industry veteran.NOTE: This release was published by Indie Research Advisors, LLC, a registered investment advisor with CRD #131926.Interested parties may visit adviserinfo.sec.gov for additional information.Past performance does not guarantee future results.Investors should always research companies and securities before making any investments.Nothing herein should be construed as an offer or solicitation to buy or sell any security.CONTACT: Marcia Martin, Next Inning Technology Research, +1 888 278 5515  SOURCE Indie Research Advisors, LLC  Copyright C 2010 PR Newswire.All rights reserved U.S. suspects Goldman tip off on Buffett deal: WSJ
