Citibank (NYSE: C) will soon be introducing additional debt and equity products in Bangladesh, India according to a report from AHN Media on Tuesday.
The disclosure from Citibank came after the New York-based banking giant raised $102 million by amortizing secured local currency bonds for Orascom Telecom Bangladesh Limited (OTBL) on a private placement basis, marking the largest bond offering in the South Asian Country
&#8220;We remain committed to bring in more customized solutions for our esteemed clients and have always geared towards continuous solutions building for them,&#8221; said a Citibank official to AHN Media.
He added: &#8220;We&#8217;re working continuously to bring new debt and equity products for local corporate, mutational corporate and micro-finance institutions to facilitate their business activities.&#8221;
OTBL, a subsidiary of Egypt-based Orascom Telecom Holdings, is the second largest wireless operator in Bangladesh.
Citibankâ€™s local Dhaka unit served as the sole investment banking agent for the transaction.
The bonds being offered will amortize over 4.5 years and have a fixed interest rate of 13.5% annually.
OTBL will utilize the proceeds from the offering to expand and upgrade its existing telecommunications networks.
