Merck MRK options trader opens an eight way trade<b><font color='firebrick'> Expecting high volatility</font></b>, Merck traders open a complex spread
</br>
 by Early Tuesday afternoon, one trader orchestrated a complex eight way trade in  options, essentially projecting a dichotomy in volatility for the October and the January expiration months.Without further ado, let me outline the legs of this intricate spread.All of these legs traded simultaneously, but it may be easier to look at the strategy month by month.In the October series:
</br>
In this month, the trader is buying the &#8220;meat&#8221; of the trade – the closer to the money 38 strike straddle – while selling the &#8220;wings,&#8221; or the further from the money 35 puts and 41 calls.This is the direct opposite of the strategy employed in the January series options, as detailed below.In the January series:
</br>
In the January month, the investor sold the &#8220;meat&#8221; of the trade the closer to the money 35 put and 40 call and bought the &#8220;wings,&#8221; or the further out January 30 put and January 45 call.So in sum, the trader sold more than he bought in October and bought more than he sold in January.Additionally, he traded twice as many contracts overall in the January series.The entire trade is close to gamma neutral so delta won&#8217;t change that much as the stock moves and is close to theta neutral so will be little affected by time decay .What is notable is that the combined trade is that it is long vega, and will therefore react dramatically to changes in implied volatility in the shares.The rationale behind this complex play is that once October expiration rolls around, implied volatility in the January options will have appreciated.So what does this trade look like as of today?Well, let&#8217;s take a look at the charts below, built in my virtual trading account.This is the arc of both trades as they look right now.If Merck<b><font color='red'> were to plunge lower</font></b> or rally higher, the<b><font color='red'> losses</font></b> in the<b><font color='green'> October position</font></b> would be more than<b><font color='green'> offset by the gains in the January position</font></b>, because the later dated trade is twice as large.For example, in the unlikely event that MRK would drop all the way to 20, the October position would be down $2.5 million while the January trade would be up about $3.5 million, resulting in a net gain.Click here to enlarge
