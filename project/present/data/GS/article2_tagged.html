In its annual letter to shareholders,  NYSE:GS and its chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, are on the defensive.Blankfein defends the bank's moves in securing its payout from American International Group Inc. and states the firm has always placed its clients' needs first and suggests that it never bet against them.The latter assertion is somewhat disingenuous.Blankfein appears to be referring to charges that Goldman made bets against mortgage securities it underwrote, a claim<b><font color='red'> laid bare in January at the Financial Inquiry Commission. ¬ † &quot</font></b>;It sounds to me a little bit like selling a car with faulty brakes, then buying an insurance policy on the buyer of those cars,&quot; the commission chairman, Phil Angelides told Blankfein during his testimony.‚Äì Thanks for visiting , to assist your investing research  that link directly to articles related to the given stock/security.Share WallStNation.com Content
