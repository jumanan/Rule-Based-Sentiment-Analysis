</br>
 Thursday, 25 March 2010 07:08 OLLI PEKKA KALLASVUO, the CEO of Nokia, received a hefty 68 per cent raise in compensation last year.According to information filed with regulators in America, Kallasvuo received 5.3 million euros in pay during 2009, up from 3.2 million the prior year.Last year the total pay for the mobile phone company’s executive board was 20.4 million euros.In 2008 the group received 13.7 million.The main reason for the rise in pay was that share based compensation more than doubled.Nokia<b><font color='red'> did not have a good year</font></b>.Sales fell 19 per cent and profit plummeted 78 per cent.The total global workforce was cut by 2,276 employees.Investors have suffered as well.The share price fell 20 per cent during 2009 after a 58 per cent fall in 2008.In both years the stock price underperformed the market average, but a strong dividend payout has softened the hit on owners.Although Nokia executives<b><font color='green'> enjoyed a healthy rise in compensation last year</font></b>, they are still paid much less than 2007 levels.That year the CEO earned 8.2 million euros while the total management team took home 33.5 million.Top executives are usually compensated with a mixed package including a fixed salary, fringe benefits and bonuses.Bonuses normally contain payments for reaching both short term and long term goals and are often paid in a mixture of cash, company stock and options.As executives are paid for long term goals, yearly earnings and management pay typically don’t move in tandem.Latest added news and articles
