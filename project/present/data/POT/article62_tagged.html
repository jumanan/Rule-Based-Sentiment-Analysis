AGU released its earnings filing on 02/09.The company reported a change in quarter over quarter sales of 40.76% and posted an EPS trailing twelve months of 2.92.One way to gauge performance is look at a stock compared to other stocks in its industry with similar market caps.AGU peer Terra Industries Inc.

CF saw a 6.91% gain.So with a return of 14.97%, Agrium Inc. saw less price gain than TRA and beat CF’s price performance over the last month.Now, let’s see how Agrium Inc. stock performance compares to the rest of the market by looking at it compared to the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index .INX .Since 02/09, the S&P 500 index has returned around 6.5%, and again, AGU saw about a 14.97% gain during that time.Not bad.Compared to the rest of the “Agricultural Chemicals” industry
