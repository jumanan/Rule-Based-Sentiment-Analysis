Citibank’s (NYSE: C) team of equity strategists have cut their stance on the worldwide financial sector to “neutral”, down from “overweight” on Thursday, citing the sector’s ultra-high beta equity trade in recent years.
Citi noted that global equities are up more than 63% from their March 2009 lows and that the magnitude of the rebound has been consistent with the bear market that preceded the rebound.
&#8220;Global equities typically grind higher in months 12 to 36 of a market recovery. So buy the dips and don&#8217;t chase the rallies too hard,&#8221; they said.
“Outperformance for ultra high beta sectors tends to fade one year after the market bottom”, they added.
