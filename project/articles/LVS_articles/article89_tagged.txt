Mar.14 Cranes once swooped, welders once flashed and hopes once ran high at many valley construction projects that broke ground just before the ground broke beneath the economy.Now, behind their padlocked fences, the predominant activity is rust.Sadly these abandoned skeletons stand, monuments to failure, a constant reminder of a bet Las Vegas lost on itself."Projects have been halted over the years for a number of reasons," said Neil Opfer, associate professor of construction management at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas."But we've never seen projects being halted on this scale." 
To find out what will happen to six of these sites, we consulted their owners who were unsurprisingly mum and sought opinions from Opfer and another construction expert, vegastodayandtomorrow.com blogger Mark Adams.The silver lining, according to Opfer, is that our dry climate will let these structures stand for another 10 years five guaranteed before decay requires remedial action or tear down.The economic climate is another matter.3000 Las Vegas Blvd.South 
It was supposed to have risen from the ashes of the Stardust this year.Instead, this $4.8 billion project began the Strip deconstruction trend in August 2008.After building a central plant and four nine story shells to various degrees of incompletion, Boyd Gaming laid off its construction crew and design team.Eventually, the cranes were removed."It can't be good for Vegas when tourists look out their windows and see signs of trouble like this," Opfer said.Last November, Keith Smith, Boyd's chief executive officer, told the Review Journal that Echelon will be revived, in some form, but not for another three to five years.SHOPS AT SUMMERLIN CENTRE

In May 2008, a news release from General Growth Properties boasted that Macy's, Dillard's, Nordstrom and Crate and Barrel would anchor a 1.5 million square foot shopping center so luxurious, "center" could only be spelled "re." Two years later, "re" stands for restitution.General Growth, now bankrupt, recently settled with three construction companies attempting to foreclose on its Red Rock Resort adjacent property.It's anybody's guess what will happen to the structures, which were 40 percent completed when work stopped in October 2008.Opfer's guess is five or 10 years before retail can establish itself.2755 Las Vegas Blvd.South 
Because it's 70 percent finished, this $3 billion project is less of an eyesore than its rusty neighbor across the street.Subscribe to Rate this Commentary
