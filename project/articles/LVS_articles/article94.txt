Las Vegas Sands (LVS) Could Test Resistance Levels Soon
Posted: Thursday, March 11, 2010 9:21 AM EDT 
Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS) closed yesterday at $19.73. So far the stock has hit a 52-week low of $1.40 and 52-week high of $20.73. Las Vegas Sands stock has been showing support around 18.63 and resistance in the 20.39 range. Technical indicators for the stock are Bullish and S&P gives LVS a weak 2 STAR (out of 5) sell rating. LVS appears on the Investors Observer Volume Leaders list. For a hedged play on this stock, look at a Jan '11 17.50 covered call for a net debit in the $14.68 area. That is also the break even stock price for this trade. This covered call has a 317 day duration, provides 25.60% downside protection and a 19.21% assigned return rate for a 22.12% annualized return rate (comparison purposes only). A lower cost hedged play for this stock would use a longer term call option in place of the covered call stock purchase. To use this strategy look at going long the LVS Jan '11 15 Call and selling the Jan '11 17.50 call for a $1.60 debit. The trade has a 317 day life and would provide 15.86% downside protection and a 56.25% assigned return rate for a 65.00% annualized return rate (for comparison purposes only). Las Vegas Sands does not pay dividends at this time. [THA-Seven Summits Research]
