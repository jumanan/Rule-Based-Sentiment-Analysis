  Call Trading Begins to Grow Toward Las Vegas Sands LVS  Jocelynn Drake jdrake@sir inc.com  3/17/2010 9:02:51 AM Las Vegas Sands LVS was the focus of some brisk options trading on Tuesday, as more than 110,400 contracts changed hands.This surge in volume was more than double the stock's average daily trading volume of 54,834 contracts, according to data from WhatsTrading.com.In addition, 74% of the volume crossed the tape on the call side.In fact, call trading is on the rise among options players, as the International Securities Exchange ISE has reported nearly three calls purchased to open for every one put purchased to open during the past 10 trading sessions.This ratio of calls to puts is higher than 57% of all those taken during the past year, indicating a growing preference for calls.However, options players are far from an optimistic extreme.The Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio comes in at 0.89, which is in the 100th percentile rank.In other words, short term options players have not been more pessimistically aligned toward the shares at any other time during the past 12 months.Short interest is also on the rise.During the past month, the number of LVS shares sold short increased by 5% to nearly 50 million.This accumulation of pessimistic positions accounts for more than 15% of the company's total float and could fuel a sharp rally in the shares.View Most Recent Blogs

 4/23/2010 10:00:05 AM
 Stocks are indicated higher after European markets moved up on optimism for Greece Friday.Thirty minutes before the opening bell on Wall Street, stock index futures indicate that both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the NASDAQ will open with modest gains.\n

\nThe euro has come off its best levels, however, and is flat at 1.3283 against the buck.The dollar added .64 to 94.08 against the yen.\n
\nIn the US, stock index futures also came off their best levels after a report on Durable Goods showed an unexpected decline of 1.3 percent in March.Economists were looking for an increase of .1 percent.\n
\nA report on New Home Sales comes into focus at 10:00 a.m. eastern time.Economists expect to see an increase to an annualized rate of 330K in March, up from 308K the month before.\n
\nBonds are under pressure ahead of the data and on diminishing concerns about Greece.The yield on the benchmark ten year Treasury is up to 3.81 percent, from 3.77 percent the day before.\n
\nSome of the commodity related names might see relative weakness after crude oil lost 55 cents to $83.15 a barrel and gold slipped $5.2 to $1137.70 an ounce.\n
\nMeanwhile, the days earnings news isnt inspiring either.Microsoft MSFT shares lost 1.3 percent after the company reported a 45 cent per share quarterly profit, which beat Street estimates by 3 cents, but revenues that didnt live up to some expectations.Dow components Travelers TRV and American Express AXP are seeing mixed post earnings action.TRV slipped 3 percent.AXP added 2.4 percent.\n Read more at WhatsTrading.com

 Big Prints in Fannie Mae FNM after a strategist bought 52500 June 1 puts for .10 to sell 53000 January 2012 $1 puts at 29 cents.Shares are flat at $1.22.The action looks similar to trade seen on Feb 5 when a strategist sold the Mar Jan 2012 $1 put spread 118,000X which was apparently a roll from Mar to Jan2012s.Today's spread looks the same and is possibly a premium seller willing to buy shares at $1 minus the money collected for selling puts should FNM dip back below $1 per share by the January 2012 expiration.Read more at WhatsTrading.com
