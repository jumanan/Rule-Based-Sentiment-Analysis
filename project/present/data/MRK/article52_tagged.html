Reckitt Benckiser Buys Suboxone, Subutex Rights For GBP100 Million
</br>
 LONDON Dow Jones Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC RB.LN , which provides household, health and personal care products, said Friday it is buying back the sales and marketing rights to the buprenorphine containing products Suboxone, Subutex and Temgesic from Merck & Co., Inc  for GBP100 million.The rights were due to revert to RB mid 2012; the majority will now revert from July 1.The incremental net revenue to RB associated with these rights would have been GBP80 million for full year 2009, if RB had owned them.RB currently has management control of the sales and marketing of these products in only two sizeable markets, namely the U.S. and Australia.RB will have a wholly owned international franchise for Suboxone and Subutex.RB and Merck's MSD will work closely to ensure a smooth transition.Company will invest in additional sales and marketing capability.Given the current scale of the business outside of the U.S. and the investment needed, the impact of this transaction on RB's financial results in 2010 will be limited.RB shares at 1410 GMT up 40 pence, or 1.1%, at 3556 pence valuing the company at GBP25.69 billion.Copyright &copy; 2009 Dow Jones Newswires
