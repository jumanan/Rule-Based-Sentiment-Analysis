Soleil Securities maintains a 'Sell' rating on Potash Corp. NYSE:  , raises price target from $85 to $100.Soleil analyst says, "We've updated our view of normalized earnings in a separate industry report, "Ferts Over Their Skis Relative to the Corn Price." We increase EPS estimates for both 2010E and 2011E; the former based on higher potash shipments and resulting lower COS per tonne; the later based on better spreads in ammonia between selling prices and plunging natural gas costs...We increase our below consensus price target to $100 from $85, consensus is $130.Still, at current levels, the shares are trading at fully 10x our generous peak EPS estimate of $12.50.This is based on the annualized run rate for the sweet spot of the blow off year of 2008."
