Health Care Stocks Largely Unfazed By Landmark House Vote
</br>
The health care sector rallied to nearly 52 week highs on Monday as the markets appear to be unfazed by the House’s historic vote over the weekend that cleared the final major hurdle for passage of comprehensive health care reform.The modest rally in the health sector was led by drug makers such as Pfizer  and further bolstered by hospital operator Tenet Healthcare  and medical device makers like Medtronic “It’s over!Getting a lot of the uncertainty around this legislation out of the way is important,” said Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.“The sector had discounted the likelihood of this legislation a while ago.”

The Morgan Stanley healthcare SPDR continued its 2010 surge, gaining 1.77% to a 52 week high of $1621.51.The exchange traded fund is now up nearly 90% year to date.There are a number of perceived winners in the industry in the wake of the House’s passage of President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul, including drug makers, device companies and health insurers.Those three industries are set to benefit from a change in the legislation that will delay taxes on the group.At the same time, most of the industry is likely to benefit from higher health care volumes, which translates to more prescriptions being filled, more hospital beds being occupied and medical devices being purchased.On the other hand, the overhaul is considered a negative for health insurers such as Aetna  and WellPoint  amid tighter regulation.Yet both companies’ stocks were trading up and Aetna hit a 52 week high as there is a sigh of relief the uncertainty has been removed and the legislation didn’t include a public option.“It’s not the worst case scenario,” said Kleintop, who also noted the group had been trading at very low levels due to the uncertainty.Health insurers are also expected to add new business due to the reform, with lawmakers saying 30 million extra Americans could have insurance now.Personal Finance Investing Financial News Business News Stock Market Quotes & News Small Business
