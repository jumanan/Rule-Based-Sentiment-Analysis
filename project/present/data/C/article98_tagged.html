NYSE: C has already implemented a similar policy.While this move will save consumers from surprise hits to their accounts, this will cost BofA millions in fee income as more than 60% of all overdraft fees charged by the bank are for debit card transactions.The new overdraft rule will apply to new customers from June 19, 2010 and for existing customers effective August.However, BofA customers still could withdraw more than their balance from ATMs, but they will have to pay a $35 overdraft fee.Last week, the Treasury received net proceeds of $1.5 billion from the sale of warrants entitling it to purchase BofA common stock.BofA is the first among four banks whose warrants are scheduled to be sold via auctions this month.The three other banks are Washington Federal Nasdaq: WFSL , Texas Capital Bancshares Nasdaq: TCBI and Signature Bank Nasdaq: SBNY .Want more from Zacks Equity Research?Subscribe to the free Profit from the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=5514.About Zacks Equity Research Zacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long term.Continuous coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.Our analysts are organized by industry which gives them keen insights to developments that affect company profits and stock performance.Recommendations and target prices are six month time horizons.Zacks "Profit from the Pros" e mail newsletter provides highlights of the latest analysis from Zacks Equity Research.Subscribe to this free newsletter today: http://at.zacks.com/?id=5516 Zacks.com is a property of Zacks Investment Research, Inc., which was formed in 1978 by Leonard Zacks.As a PhD in mathematics Len knew he could find patterns in stock market data that would lead to superior investment results.Amongst his many accomplishments was the formation of his proprietary stock picking system; the Zacks Rank, which continues to outperform the market by nearly a 3 to 1 margin.The best way to unlock the profitable stock recommendations and market insights of Zacks Investment Research is through our free daily email newsletter; Profit from the Pros.In short, it's your steady flow of Profitable ideas GUARANTEED to be worth your time!Register for your free subscription to Profit from the Pros at http://at.zacks.com/?id=4580.Visit http://www.zacks.com/performance for information about the performance numbers displayed in this press release.Follow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/zacksresearch Join us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/pages/Zacks Investment Research/57553657748?ref=ts Disclaimer: Past performance does not guarantee future results.Investors should always research companies and securities before making any investments.Nothing herein should be construed as an offer or solicitation to buy or sell any security.Zacks.com Mark Vickery Web Content Editor 312 265 9380 Visit: www.zacks.com For full details on Citigroup C .Citigroup C has Short Term PowerRatings at TradingMarkets.Details on Citigroup C Short Term PowerRatings is available at For full details on Washington Federal Inc WFSL .Washington Federal Inc WFSL has Short Term PowerRatings at TradingMarkets.Details on Washington Federal Inc WFSL Short Term PowerRatings is available at For full details on Bank Of America Corp BAC .Bank Of America Corp BAC has Short Term PowerRatings at TradingMarkets.Details on Bank Of America Corp BAC Short Term PowerRatings is available at For full details on Signature Bank SBNY .Signature Bank SBNY has Short Term PowerRatings at TradingMarkets.Details on Signature Bank SBNY Short Term PowerRatings is available at For full details on Texas Capital Bancshares TCBI .Texas Capital Bancshares TCBI has Short Term PowerRatings at TradingMarkets.Details on Texas Capital Bancshares TCBI Short Term PowerRatings is available at Learn new strategies, how to trade in this market, and the stocks you should be focusing on each day.Join us for our  20 minute tele seminars during the week.Thursday April 29 12:30 PM Hear What Kevin Haggerty Sees in the Stock Market Today!Wednesday April 28 01:00 PM Hear What Gary Kaltbaum Sees in the Stock Market Today!* Attendance is strictly limited and are filled on a first come, first served basis. </br>
