There's No Business Like FOX Business
A six-day win streak for the Nasdaq Composite came to an anticlimactic conclusion on Friday as conflicting indicators on the health of the U.S. consumer and sustainability of the economic recovery left the markets at yet another standstill. 
 Industrial Average rose 12.85 points, or 0.12%, to 10624.69, the Standard & Poor's 500 fell 0.25 points, or 0.02%, to 1149.99 and the

Wall Street opened solidly higher after the government surprised the markets by saying retail sales unexpectedly rose in February. However, enthusiasm for that report was offset by new data revealing consumer sentiment deteriorated in the beginning of March. 
The conflicting economic reports are the latest mixed signals that Wall Street needs to sort out about the sustainability of the economic recovery. 
“The same thing plaguing the consumer is the same thing plaguing the average investor,” NYSE trader Ted Weisberg of Seaport Securities told FOX Business. “The vast majority of investors are still licking their wounds from a year ago. It was an ugly experience. It’s going to take not a market up 70% in 12 months but an economy and a market that repairs itself to bring the individual investor back.“

Stocks hit session lows Friday morning after the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index slumped to a 72.5 reading in mid-March, surprising economists who had forecasted sentiment would stay flat at 73.6. 
The disappointing sentiment data stand at odds with an earlier report from the 
Commerce Department
, which showed retail sales rose 0.3% in February, easily beating expectations for a drop of 0.2%. Excluding auto sales, retail sales jumped 0.8%. The impressive performance came in the face of heavy snowfall on the East Coast that economists had expected would keep consumers away from malls.
Consumer discretionary stocks such as

Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar took a hit amid reports that Janet Yellen, a dovish Federal Reserve governor, is being eyed by the White House as the new Fed vice chairman. Her dovish stance on monetary policy could increase chances interest rates will remain low to push economic growth, further hurting the dollar. 
Crude oil fell 87 cents a barrel, or 1.06%, to $81.24. Capping off its worst week in almost two months, gold sank $6.50 a troy ounce, or 0.59%, to $1101.50.
