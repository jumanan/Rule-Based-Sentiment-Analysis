 US Treasury Plans To Sell Citigroup Inc. Common Stock-DJ
Monday, 29 Mar 2010 09:25am EDT
Dow Jones reported that the U.S. Treasury Department plans to sell roughly 7.7 billion Citigroup Inc. common shares this year. The Treasury received the shares as part of an agreement in 2009 that allowed the U.S. government to receive common shares in exchange for preferred stock. The Treasury acquired the preferred stock from Citigroup through the capital purchase program as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, which helped bail out financial firms during the financial crisis. As of March 24, a Treasury report said its total investment of common stock and warrants in Citigroup is valued at $25 billion. The sale announced Monday won't affect the Treasury's holdings of Citigroup trust preferred securities or warrants for its common stock. The Treasury said that it will sell Citigroup common shares into the market through various means in an orderly and measured fashion and that the manner, amount and timing of the sale is dependent upon a number of factors. The Treasury said it would use a pre-arranged written trading plan, but didn't elaborate further.

 US Judge Rules Against Citigroup Inc. In Terra Suit Over EMI-Reuters
Wednesday, 24 Mar 2010 04:43pm EDT
Reuters reported that Citigroup Inc. lost a bid to move a lawsuit by Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd to London in a dispute over the buyout house's acquisition of music group EMI. An order by a U.S. Judge in New York was a victory for Terra Firma Chairman and Chief Executive Guy Hands, who has become embroiled in an increasingly bitter legal dispute with the U.S. bank, which advised on and provided financing for Terra Firma's GBP4 billion ($6.3 billion) acquisition of EMI Group Plc. Terra Firma asked the U.S. court to hear the case over its troubled deal for EMI, rather than shift the proceedings to London, a move it said could jeopardize the tax status of Hands, the firm's founder. Terra Firma accusing Citigroup of inflating the price of EMI by not revealing the only remaining bidder, Cerberus Capital Management, had withdrawn from the auction. The deal at the height of the buyout bubble has come to epitomize the worst aspects of private equity deal-making, with a high debt burden and a weak performance crippling the business.
