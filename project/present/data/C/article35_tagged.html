Will an Immediate Sale of Citigroup NYSE: C Stock from the U.S. Treasury Shortchange Taxpayers?March 27th, 2010 &bull;  &bull; by admin  Filed Under: Many predict that the U.S. Treasury will soon<b><font color='red'> divest itself from Citigroup NYSE</font></b>: C , but an immediate sale of the government&#8217;s 27% stake in Citigroup may short change tax payers.The federal government&#8217;s 27% ownership stake in Citigroup currently represents about $33 billion in value on the open market.If the U.S. treasury were able to sell all of its share at the current stock price of $4.31, it would net about $8 billion and profit off of its $25 billion investment, but its current share price is well below the stock&#8217;s 52 week high of $5.43.There<b><font color='firebrick'> are also several signs that indicate Citigroup&</font></b>#8217;s share price<b><font color='green'> is headed in a positive direction</font></b>.Analyst Richard Bove of Rochdale Securities expects bank stocks to trade at quadruple their current share price by 2012.In an interview with Business Week on March 24th, Bove commented that “The catalyst is the reduction in loan losses.That’s all that investors in banks care about.&#8221;

Bove&#8217;s optimism about the financial industry as a whole is not the conventional wisdom among analysts, but with<b><font color='green'> recent optimistic comments</font></b> by Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit and its<b><font color='green'> successful sale</font></b> of<b><font color='red'> several</font></b> of its<b><font color='green'> non profitable businesses</font></b> in its Citi Holdings unit, many believe that Citigroup will soon<b><font color='green'> return to sustained profitability</font></b>.Many analyst have target prices for Citigroup between $6.50 and $8.00 per share.If the government were to hold out another 6 months to 1 year, the government could turn their $8 billion profit somewhere into a $15 or $20 billion profit.If Bove&#8217;s prediction is correct, the Treasury Department&#8217;s ownership share in Citigroup would be worth $131 billion, representing a $106<b><font color='green'> billion profit</font></b>.However, many would argue that the government is not in the business of investing in single stocks.Others would<b><font color='red'> argue that</font></b> there&#8217;s a possibility that Citigroup&#8217;s stock will<b><font color='red'> decline</font></b> and that the Treasury Department should get out while it&#8217;s ahead.blog comments powered by </br>
