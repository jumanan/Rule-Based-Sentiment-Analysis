 C:NYSE shares finished above $4 on Thursday for the first time since early December.This slideshow looks at the stock's ups and downs over the past year.<b><font color='red'> Breaking the Buck</font></b>: March 5, 2009
</br>
At this time Citigroup was still one of the thirty supposed "blue chip" companies that comprised the Dow Jones Industrial Average
</br>
 and the stock's<b><font color='red'> drop</font></b> below $1 was astounding psychological evidence of just how<b><font color='red'> bad</font></b> the markets had gotten.The company was eventually dropped from the Dow in June 2009, at the same time as American automotive icon The pair were replaced with some irony by  CSCO:NYSE and  TRV:NYSE , a remnant of the company that Citicorp had merged with in 1998 to form the original Citigroup.Strong Quarter, Weak Stock: April 14, 2009
</br>
Shares close at $4.01 as buying interest builds ahead of the company's first quarter report, which was released on April 17.At the time it represents the stock's first close above $4 since late January 2009.The first quarter numbers hold up pretty well as revenue gets a boost from strong trading results to reach $24.8 billion but credit costs jump 76% year over year to $10.3 billion.CEO Vikram Pandit pictured above describes the performance as "our best overall quarter since the second quarter of 2007" but the stock can't hold the gains and it dips back below $3 in the weeks that follow.The Peak: August 27, 2009
</br>
August's rally proves fleeting as a summer romance.The stock pulls back in September before making another run to close at exactly $5 on Oct. 14, 2009, just ahead of the company's third quarter report.Shares loses 5% the next day, despite Citigroup coming in with net income of $101 million for the three month period, and the stock hasn't seen $5 since.November<b><font color='red'> saw a decline in equity trading</font></b> volumes overall and all the most heavily traded names, Citigroup included, reflected this trend.Market observers attributed the slowdown to investors choosing to take profits a bit earlier than usual, given the volatility of 2009, and the incredible run ups many stocks had seen from their March lows.Payback: December 7, 2009
</br>
The shares' last close above $4 before yesterday.Speculation that the company was planning to repay bailout funds before the end of the year began to surface at this time, and the stock<b><font color='green'> slumped on worries of a dilutive share sale</font></b>.Citigroup eventually priced a $17 billion equity offering at $3.15 per share as part of its TARP repayment plan.That $3.15 level now represents the near term closing low for the stock, a mark finished at on January 26 and then again on Feb. 8, a little over a month ago.The late January decline came more than a week after the company posted its fourth quarter results.In general, investors cooled to the big banks after earnings season because of regulatory fears and concerns about still significant credit costs and the fragile economic recovery.New Hope: March 9, 2010
</br>
Citigroup surges 7% on<b><font color='green'> strong volume</font></b> of 1.1 billion amid<b><font color='green'> positive commentary</font></b> from<b><font color='green'> influential investor Bruce Berkowitz</font></b> of Fairholme Capital Management pictured above and debt research firm , as well as news that it's seeing heavy demand for its sale of $2 billion in trust preferred securities.A report that the U.S. Treasury could look to begin selling its 27% stake within the next three months is also a factor.The close at $3.82 is its highest since Dec. 11, 2009.Driven by the favorable pricing of the TrUPs and a bullish presentation from CEO Pandit, the stock continues to rise and the rally culminates with Thursday's finish at $4.18, which puts the shares up more than 25% year to date, tops among the big banks.The<b><font color='red'> question</font></b> becomes: What will it take for investors to<b><font color='red'> be willing</font></b> to slap down a finsky for single Citigroup share?Written by Michael Baron in New York
