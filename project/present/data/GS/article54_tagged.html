 Source: Fund Strategy Western multinationals are becoming more interested in emerging
</br>
economies as they are growing faster and are in some respects more
</br>
stable than the developed world.Rodrigo Amaral reports.With the developed world drowning in debt, crisis of confidence,
</br>
high unemployment and other economic ills, it is up to emerging
</br>
markets to provide most of the action in the global markets this
</br>
year and beyond.Countries such as Brazil, China and India have shrugged off the
</br>
crisis more promptly than America and western Europe and have been
</br>
firmly treading the path of growth for several months.Equity
</br>
markets are likely to mirror this development, with exchanges in
</br>
places like Hong Kong, Mumbai and Sao Paulo delivering the most
</br>
sustained rates of growth in 2010, as was already the case last
</br>
year.Companies in many emerging markets enjoy the delights of booming
</br>
consumption levels, access to bank credit, high expectations of
</br>
public and private investment and other advantages that their peers
</br>
working in developed countries can only dream of.Emerging markets, however, were prone to make investors shudder
</br>
with the expectation of high losses.As a result, prudent investors
</br>
have limited exposure to these economies.Experts argue that we live in a different world ever since the
</br>
words "subprime mortgages", "Lehman Brothers" and "Greece" became an
</br>
inseparable part of our daily complaints.But anyone who had a bad
</br>
experience in Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand, and other Asian
</br>
economies in 1997 can find many reasons to maintain a cautious
</br>
approach.It was the same with Russia in 1998.Or Brazil in 2002.Or
</br>
Ecuador in 2008.And Venezuela's currency devaluation earlier this
</br>
year.Political instability, high levels of currency volatility and
</br>
asset bubbles are frequent threats in fast growing emerging
</br>
economies: some analysts are forecasting that China is nurturing a
</br>
property bubble.There is no doubt you can make a killing in
</br>
emerging markets, but it will often be at the price of more grey
</br>
hair on investors' heads.That is why many investors are looking at alternatives to take
</br>
advantage of the high performance of emerging markets while reducing
</br>
the fear factor associated with dealing with them.One of them is to
</br>
invest in shares of multinational companies that are listed on
</br>
western exchanges, but should be able to dodge the sluggish
</br>
prospects of their home countries by having a high exposure to fast
</br>
growing countries in Asia, Africa or Latin America.Analysts at
</br>
Goldman Sachs, the investment bank,<b><font color='red'> have even argued that such equities already form a new asset class</font></b>.Selected multinational
</br>
companies listed in developed countries provide a "less focused but
</br>
more stable exposure" than firms based in the emerging markets, the
</br>
bank said.They also offer more liquidity than investing in
</br>
companies based in developing countries.Equities of the 50 firms
</br>
selected by Goldman Sachs for its proposed index of developed world based firms exposed to the Bric countries Brazil, Russia, India and
</br>
China gained an average of 16% in the past three years, compared
</br>
with a loss of 20% for the MSCI World index, according to the bank.Stocks that offer this kind of exposure include some well known
</br>
names.In a recent article, Javier Santiso, the chief development
</br>
economist at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
</br>
Development's development centre, noted that firms such as Siemens
</br>
already draw more than a third of their revenues from emerging
</br>
markets.Others, like Philips, MAN and Renault, expect that more
</br>
than half of their turnover will come from outside the developed
</br>
world by 2015.This is already the case with the Swiss firm, ABB, a
</br>
technology group, which makes 55% of its revenues from emerging
</br>
markets, and Lafarge, a French cement producer, where 65% of profits
</br>
derives from such places.That exposure to emerging markets has become a big business asset
</br>
is reflected in some of the highest profile mergers and aquistions
</br>
 M&A to have taken place in the past few months.Prudential broke
</br>
all records of acquisitions in the insurance sector by paying $35
</br>
billion pound 23 billion for AIG's Asian insurance arm.The
</br>
operation will turn Prudential into the largest insurance company in
</br>
the fast growing Asian markets however, investors at first punished
</br>
its stock after the deal was announced .The rationale behind
</br>
Kraft's controversial pound 11.5 billion swallowing of Cadbury's
</br>
also stressed the strength of the British sweet maker in markets
</br>
like Egypt, India, Mexico and Thailand.No one wants to look like
</br>
the firm that is staying off the growth bandwagon without good
</br>
reason."At the moment, it seems that emerging markets are leading
</br>
the world economy out of the global recession and into recovery,"
</br>
says Alex Tarver, an emerging market product specialist at HSBC
</br>
Global Asset Management.Goldman Sachs has estimated that two billion people will have
</br>
joined the middle classes by 2030, thanks to the rapid economic
</br>
growth of developing countries.Subscribe to Rate this Commentary
