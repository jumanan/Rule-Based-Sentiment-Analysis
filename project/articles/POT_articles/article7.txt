Potash (POT) Showing Bullish Technicals With Support At 118.49
Posted: Tuesday, March 30, 2010 9:28 AM EDT 
Potash (NYSE: POT) closed yesterday at $120.53. So far the stock has hit a 52-week low of $77.14 and 52-week high of $128.42. Potash stock has been showing support around 118.49 and resistance in the 123.57 range. Technical indicators for the stock are Bullish and S&P gives POT a neutral 3 STAR (out of 5) hold rating. POT appears on the Investors Observer Analysts Favorites list. For a hedged play on this stock, look at a May '10 120 covered call for a net debit in the $113.08 area. That is also the break even stock price for this trade. This covered call has a 53 day duration, provides 6.18% downside protection and a 6.12% assigned return rate for a 42.14% annualized return rate (comparison purposes only). A lower cost hedged play for this stock would use a longer term call option in place of the covered call stock purchase. To use this strategy look at going long the POT Jan '11 70 Call and selling the May '10 120 call for a $45.10 debit. The trade has a 53 day life and would provide 4.51% downside protection and a 10.86% assigned return rate for a 75.00% annualized return rate (for comparison purposes only). Potash has a current annual dividend yield of 0.33%. [ATU-Seven Summits Research]
