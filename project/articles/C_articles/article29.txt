 TORONTO, Mar 29, 2010 (MARKETWIRE via COMTEX) -- 
The Bedford Report is pleased to announce that its latest Market Update analyzing recent news and events on Citigroup, Inc. (NYSE: 
), Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ: 
), Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: 
) and Southern Union Co. (NYSE: 
) has been released. 
US Stocks are up today as an increase in consumer spending has boosted investor confidence in the economy. In this issue of The Bedford Report we predict whether or not the recent gain by Baidu is expected to be a permanent upward trend, and explain why a recovery in the equity markets could lead Southern Union to form an MLP out of its natural gas gathering business. We also examine why shares of Citigroup are trading down today, despite the pleasing news that The US Treasury Department said it was moving closer to unloading its 27% stake in the bank, and we review Ford's sale of its Volvo subsidiary to the Chinese conglomerate, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group. There is much more analysis regarding these companies and many more available at www.bedfordreport.com. 
Our updated analyst reports on Citigroup, Baidu, Ford and Southern Union include: 
-- An unbiased view and rating of the company -- Recent key developments -- Solid analyst summary -- who's saying what and why? -- In-depth industry analysis and outlook -- Major upcoming events to watch out for
