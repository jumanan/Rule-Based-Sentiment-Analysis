Tokyo was up 125 points last night gaining 1.17% after the Bank of Japan doubled its lending program to $221 billion.London is up almost half a percent in early trade.US futures are trading marginally higher pre market.I took a few longs overnight LVS, FCX, V, AGU, GLD and I'm looking for momentum continuation today.Jim Rogers believes the euro is destined for failure in 15 20 years.He is currently long but he says, "We've had currency unions in history, they didn't survive, this one won't survive either".For the US, he is certain of one thing: "Yes we're going to have another recession, I guarantee you.Certainly by 2012 say, it's time for another recession".I didn't really want to hear that.Let's hope he's wrong though I fear he's going to be right.I'm waiting on gold to break through the 1,140 area before it really gets rockin' again.The consolidation action above previous all time highs has been very healthy.A move above the trendline would signal a change in the short term trend and I will get much more aggressively long.Research Related Stocks: Rate this Commentary
