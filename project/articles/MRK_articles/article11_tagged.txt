Cislak was travelling.A Novartis spokesperson said he needs more time to reply as many of his team members were on Easter holidays."India's patent system currently provides adequate opportunity to challenge patents that have been allegedly granted wrongly," said Tapan Ray, director general of the Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India, an industry lobby that represents foreign drug makers in India.One practical difficulty that opponents face is the vague description of patent details published by the patent office before and after the grant of product protection."There were no evidences ever produced by these patent applicants that the modified forms of old drugs are superior in efficacy to qualify for a patent here," said Dilip G. Shah, secretary general of IPA, who compiled the list of patents granted to modified forms of existing drugs.IPA had appealed to the controller general of patents and James, when he was director of DIPP, for a review of the patent approvals."An investigation was on at the department to find out the routes of the frivolous patent grants, and the situation has improved a lot now due to a strict vigil while scrutinizing patent applications," he said.India's controller general of patents, designs and trademarks P.H.Kurian said: "At the present law, there is no provision to review already granted patents by the patent office once the post grant opposition period one year after the grant is over.But it can be revoked by moving the Intellectual Property Appellate Board or courts of law against the wrongly granted patents."
