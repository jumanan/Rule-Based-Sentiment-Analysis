 Editor Paul McWilliams has displayed uncanny accuracy in identifying winners and losers during this challenging and historic period for the markets. After logging a very successful 2009, McWilliams is now intently focused on the catalysts that will generate profits in 2010. 
 Most recently, McWilliams identified the timing of the market's latest dip and rebound for Next Inning readers in his quarterly Strategy Review. McWilliams has also just published a special report in the emerging and volatile solar energy sector that identifies the key drivers for the industry as well as likely winners and losers. These reports, as well as McWilliams' regular commentary, are available for free to trial subscribers. 
 In addition, a Next Inning trial subscription also offers access to the "10 Tech Trends for 2010" special report, in which McWilliams lays out this year's key tech sector stories from cloud computing to virtualization to data centers and solid state drives, and McWilliams' highly acclaimed State of Tech reports that offer in-depth sector by sector coverage of over 65 leading tech companies and McWilliams' specific guidance on which stocks he thinks investors should own and which should be avoided.

 McWilliams covers these topics and more in his recent reports: 
 Do reports from Asia signal strong demand for Intel's newest i3, i5 and i7 core processors? What other data points does McWilliams see that leads him to believe Intel has engineered "one of the most elegant product transactions" he has see in over a decade? Based on what he's seeing in the PC and server sectors, does McWilliams think there is good potential for a strong upside from Intel when it reports Q1 results next month? 
 Do feature sets in Intel's new line of server microprocessors and design trends in the server industry suggest there will be an uptick in the demand for virtualization software? What does this mean for EMC, VMware and Citrix? 
 What design trends in the server industry might lead to a short-term upside for Netlist? How does McWilliams think these trends will work out for Netlist in the longer term? How does McWilliams think investors should leverage this information? 
 What changes within the server industry have moved Citrix to center stage for two of the largest U.S. players? What leads McWilliams to call Citrix an "acquisition jewel" and which three tech companies does he think may display interest in acquiring the company in the not too distant future? 
 Founded in September 2002, Next Inning's model portfolio has returned 264% since its inception versus 29% for the S&P 500.
