SmarTrend&#039;s Candlestick Scanner Detects Bullish Engulfing Pattern for Intel (INTC)
Posted on 03/10/10 at 8:30am by 
SmarTrend's candlestick pattern scanner has detected a bullish engulfing pattern for shares of Intel (NASDAQ: 
) since the stock closed above $20.88.

Yesterday, this company traded 83,092,547 shares, versus the previous day's total volume of 35,685,723. Heavy volume increases the reliability of this bullish candlestick pattern.

SmarTrend issued an Uptrend alert on shares of Intel on February 16, 2010 at $20.70 per share (1.2% return since that call). This bullish candle pattern may point to a continuation of the previously called Uptrend.
