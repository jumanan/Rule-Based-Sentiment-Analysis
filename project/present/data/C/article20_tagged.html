Citigroup Inc. NYSE: C Investment banking giant Morgan Stanley NYSE: MS will be a significant beneficiary in the US government plan to sell off its stake in Citigroup NYSE: C over the course of 2010.Â  A contract between Morgan Stanley and the Treasury Department allows the company to charge a management fee for assisting in the sale of Citigroup shares and advising the government on additional bailout procedures in the future.The Treasury Department recently chose Morgan Stanley to manage the sale process of its 7.7 billion shares in Citigroup.Â  The agreement between the government and Morgan Stanley, stipulates that the bank will receive fees of $0.003 and $0.0175 per share, which equates to a range of $23 million to $135 million of estimated fees on the transaction.these figures reported  by the New York Times Â In addition to these fees, Morgan Stanley also stands to collect a $500,000 â€œadministration feeâ€ for its role.Â  You can review the contract between Morgan Stanley and the Treasury Department , thanks to the New York Times.The governmentsâ€™ 7.7 billion shares represent approximately 27% of<b><font color='green'> outstanding shares</font></b> of Citigroup, which were acquired in an effort to<b><font color='green'> stabilize the company by</font></b><b><font color='lime'> purchasing preferred shares under the Troubled Asset Relief Program TARP</font></b> .Â  The preferred shares were converted into common shares last summer,<b><font color='green'> making the US government the largest stakeholder in Citigroup</font></b>, and the Treasury Department indicated last month that it would<b><font color='red'> begin divesting itself of its stake in Citigroup over the remainder of 2010</font></b>.There<b><font color='green'> are justified<b><font color='red'> fears</font></b> that</font></b> selling such a large stake in Citigroup will<b><font color='red'> cause volatility in not only Citigroup shares</font></b>, but also in the broader market.Â  To counter those<b><font color='red'> fears</font></b>, the Treasury Department stated during its announcement that it would conduct the sale in â€œvarious means in an orderly and<b><font color='green'> measured fashion. â €  Despite initial<b><font color='red'> fears</font></b> that the sale</font></b> would<b><font color='red'> result in a loss for the Treasury</font></b>, it now appears the Treasury Department will likely realize a gain on the sale of the shares.Â  The shares were converted to common stock at approximately $3.25 per share, and Citigroup stock<b><font color='green'> is currently trading well above the</font></b> $4 per share mark, which if the price remains in this range, would<b><font color='green'> equate to a gain in the billions of dollars</font></b>.The sale of Citigroup shares will end the short, but<b><font color='firebrick'> extremely controversial</font></b>, stint of direct ownership of a<b><font color='red'> bailed</font></b> out financial institution during the US economic crisis.Â  The Obama Administration, the Treasury Department, and the head of the Treasury Department â€“ Timothy Geithner, have endured blistering criticism over the TARP program and ownership of Citigroup shares, and likely look forward to<b><font color='red'> putting this controversial period behind them</font></b>.blog comments powered by </br>
