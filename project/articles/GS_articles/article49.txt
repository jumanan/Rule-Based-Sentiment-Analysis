 March 11 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its forecasts for the euro against Norway&rsquo;s krone, the Swiss franc, the Swedish krona and Polish zloty, citing an &ldquo;increasing focus on growth differentiation.&rdquo;
 Strategists including London-based Thomas Stolper also revised lower their three-month forecast for the pound versus the euro as U.K elections weigh on sterling. The bank now expects smaller gains in the pound to 87 pence per euro from 91.12 pence as of 9:01 a.m. in London, compared with a previous call for it to trade at 84 pence in three months. Goldman Sachs left its six- and 12-month forecasts unchanged.
