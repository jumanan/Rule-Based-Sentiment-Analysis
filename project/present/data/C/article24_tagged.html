WASHINGTON Mounting losses from commercial real estate loans
</br>
will continue to be a problem for the U.S. and especially smaller
</br>
banks, but it can be managed, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner
</br>
said Monday."Commercial real estate's still going to be a problem for the
</br>
country," Geithner said in an interview with CNBC."But we can
</br>
manage through this process." 
</br>
Geithner also said the Treasury Department's announcement that it
</br>
will begin selling the stake it owns in Citigroup Inc., which could
</br>
net about $7.5 billion to the government, shows "how far we've come"
</br>
in exiting<b><font color='red'> the financial bailout program</font></b>.The government received 7.7 billion shares of Citigroup in
</br>
exchange for $25 billion of the total $45 billion it<b><font color='red'> gave the financial behemoth during the 2008 credit crisis</font></b>.The Treasury Department said Monday it would sell the shares over
</br>
the course of this year, depending on market conditions.Like any investor, the government will likely hold on to its
</br>
shares if prices fall steeply.However, Citi shares have been steadily rising with the broader
</br>
market in recent months, which means the government is likely to
</br>
pocket a hefty profit.Geithner said in the interview the government doesn't want to
</br>
keep an ownership stake in the financial companies "a day longer
</br>
than necessary." 
</br>
The government will use a "careful process" to balance two
</br>
objectives, he said: ensuring maximum return on the taxpayers'
</br>
investment while also getting the U.S. out of the business of owning
</br>
private companies.On other subjects, Geithner said: 
</br>
The Obama administration is optimistic that an agreement can be
</br>
reached with Republicans on legislation to bring sweeping new
</br>
regulations to the U.S. financial system, opening the way to
</br>
enactment possibly within months.The financial system "is in a much, much stronger position today"
</br>
than it was three years ago in the run up to the financial crisis,
</br>
and the U.S. economy has recovered from the crisis faster than those
</br>
of other countries.Major U.S. financial institutions have far
</br>
stronger capital positions than they did three years ago, but many
</br>
of them still face daunting challenges, he said.SUBHEAD: Losses
