Walt Disney (DIS) Could Hit New 52-Week High Today
Posted: Tuesday, March 30, 2010 9:09 AM EDT 
Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) closed yesterday at $35.16. So far the stock has hit a 52-week low of $17.54 and 52-week high of $35.60. Walt Disney stock has been showing support around 34.73 and resistance in the 35.63 range. Technical indicators for the stock are Bullish and S&P gives DIS a positive 4 STAR (out of 5) buy rating. DIS appears on the Investors Observer Analysts Favorites list. For a hedged play on this stock, look at a May '10 36 covered call for a net debit in the $34.36 area. That is also the break even stock price for this trade. This covered call has a 53 day duration, provides 2.28% downside protection and a 4.77% assigned return rate for a 32.87% annualized return rate (comparison purposes only). A lower cost hedged play for this stock would use a longer term call option in place of the covered call stock purchase. To use this strategy look at going long the DIS Jan '11 25 Call and selling the May '10 36 call for a $9.90 debit. The trade has a 53 day life and would provide 0.74% downside protection and an 11.11% assigned return rate for a 77.00% annualized return rate (for comparison purposes only). Walt Disney has a current annual dividend yield of 1.00%. [ATU-Seven Summits Research]
