2nd UPDATE: Bausch & Lomb Taps Ex Schering Executives In Rebuild
</br>
 Adds comments from new CEO Saunders  NEW YORK Dow Jones Bausch & Lomb Inc. tapped a pair of former Schering Plough executives, including naming noted drugmaker turnaround artist Fred Hassan as its new chairman, as it continues its multi year rebuilding efforts.Hassan will run the contact lens and eye care products maker along with another former Schering Plough executive, Brent Saunders, who has been named chief executive.They will be taking over amid a restructuring process that began in 2006 after a contact lens solution recall spurred lawsuits and led to Bausch & Lomb agreeing to a $3.67 billion private equity buyout by Warburg Pincus LLC in 2007.But analysts said the moves likely wouldn't result in an immediate public offering.The two will replace Chairman and Chief Executive Gerald M. Ostrov, who is retiring, but will serve as a consultant.Saunders said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires that he will run the more day to day operations while Hassan will focus on strategic planning.He said he doesn't view his mission as a turnaround but as a "power up" of an already solid company."We need to go from good to great," Saunders said."We need to become the best company in our industry, not necessarily the biggest, but the best.We have to do more with what we have."  He said that Warburg Pincus hadn't given a mandate to the two new executives that included an initial public offering."The mandate is quite simple: it's build a growth company for long term focus," Saunders said, adding they can't control "whether it's an IPO or some other event in the future."  Hassan joined the Bausch & Lomb board in November after Merck & Co.  completed its buyout of Schering Plough, a company Hassan took over after a series of missteps in 2003.He had been lured by Schering Plough after orchestrating the turnaround of Pharmacia and eventual sale to Pfizer Inc.  , a term that had gained him recognition as a rising star in the industry.Hassan has also been serving as a senior adviser to Warburg Pincus since November, a move he said at the time would involve advising the firm in a variety of industries.With his new position, Hassan, 63, will be again given some of the reins of a struggling company, this one deep in debt and run by the private equity firm.Bausch & Lomb has been fighting personal injury lawsuits over contact lens solution recalled in 2006 because of a serious fungal eye infection.The company recalled its ReNu with MoistureLoc contact solution in 2006 because of links to fusarium keratitis, a rare fungal eye infection.Sales haven't totally recovered from the recall, while competitors' new products have added to the strain.Though it has released new products, the stigma of the recall remained hanging over sales, it has appeared.Meanwhile, Saunders, 40, will take the chief executive role after also helping engineer the turnaround at Schering Plough, where he headed its consumer health care unit and served as a member of its six person executive committee.Saunders also<b><font color='green'> served as the lead person in integrating Schering Plough with Merck</font></b>.Saunders said he had multiple offers after leaving Schering Plough but chose Bausch & Lomb because it's rare to find a company with as much history.He said he had a global town hall meeting with employees already, where he introduced himself and spoke about his power up mandate.Piper Jaffray analyst Matt Miksic said its been hard to keep a close eye on Bausch & Lomb because the company hasn't been very open with financial details, but did say that Monday's hirings were impressive names.Joan E.
