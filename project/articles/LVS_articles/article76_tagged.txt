Bill Galvano, the Bradenton Republican who chairs the House committee dealing with gambling, said he and one of the panel's senior Democrats met last week with the tribe."We have moved even closer to an agreement in concept," Galvano said.He said negotiations are focused on crafting exemptions to the exclusivity agreement.Much of the state's pari mutuel industry, including Northeast Florida facilities, has lined up against the proposal, which provides the Seminoles exclusive rights to operate some games outside of Miami Dade and Broward counties.Gaming interests in the southern part of the state, particularly those outside of Dade and Broward, are concerned that the deal with the tribes will give the Seminoles' facilities an unfair advantage, while those north of Interstate 4 are worried that the deal could foreclose opportunities to expand gaming in the future."That exclusivity gives them some sort of time to build their empire," said Sen. Dennis Jones, R Seminole, who chairs his chamber's panel overseeing gambling.Jones is crafting a measure for his committee and said his fellow lawmakers will have something to consider within the next two weeks.He said the legislation would likely be different from previous drafts because of changes to the gambling landscape in the last few years including the emergence of offshore Internet gambling operations frequented by some Floridians.But Jones suggested the Senate would be unlikely to push ahead with separate legislation helping the pari mutuel industry without a compact with the Seminole tribe, a process the House started earlier this year when it rejected the latest draft of the deal."We could [consider a stand alone bill], but eventually they would have to be married," Jones said.Internet gambling interests have pushed for the state to legalize and regulate their games, and casino developers have pitched plans for the state particularly as a fall back option if lawmakers can't reach an agreement on the Indian compact.But the battle over the Seminole pact has some observers doubting the GOP dominated Legislature would go along with any expansion of gambling.Meanwhile, lawmakers remain confident that a deal with the tribe will get done for whatever that's worth."I was confident the last two years," Jones said.brandon.larrabee@jacksonville.com, To see more of The Florida Times Union or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.jacksonville.com.Copyright c 2010, The Florida Times Union, Jacksonville Distributed by McClatchy Tribune Information Services.For reprints, email tmsreprints@permissionsgroup.com, call 800 374 7985 or 847 635 6550, send a fax to 847 635 6968, or write to The Permissions Group Inc., 1247 Milwaukee Ave., Suite 303, Glenview, IL 60025, USA.For full details on Las Vegas Sands LVS .Las Vegas Sands LVS has Short Term PowerRatings at TradingMarkets.Details on Las Vegas Sands LVS Short Term PowerRatings is available at Learn new strategies, how to trade in this market, and the stocks you should be focusing on each day.Join us for our  20 minute tele seminars during the week.Thursday April 29 12:30 PM Hear What Kevin Haggerty Sees in the Stock Market Today!Wednesday April 28 01:00 PM Hear What Gary Kaltbaum Sees in the Stock Market Today!* Attendance is strictly limited and are filled on a first come, first served basis.
