Earnings season can make investing tricky. Many traders try to time trades based on earnings announcements, but usually find such trading is difficult and risky. It is often better to take a look at how the market has reacted to a company’s results a few weeks after the initial announcement. 
 Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN) [
] released its earnings announcement on 02/25. The company reported a change in quarter-over-quarter sales of 31.75% and posted an EPS (trailing twelve months) of .16.

 One way to gauge performance is look at a stock compared to other stocks in its industry with similar market caps. WYNN peer MGM Mirage (MGM) [
] has seen a 19.37% stock price gain over about the last month, while another peer, Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) [
] saw a 36.11% gain. So with a return of 19.05%, Wynn Resorts Ltd. saw less price gain than MGM and under-performed LVS’s price performance over the last month.
 Now, let’s see how Wynn Resorts Ltd. stock performance compares to the rest of the market by looking at it compared to the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (.INX). Since 02/25, the S&P 500 index has returned around 5.9%, and again, WYNN saw about a 19.05% gain during that time. Not bad.
Compared to the rest of the “Resorts & Casinos” industry
 Since the WYNN announcement (about 30 days ago), the stock has posted a 19.05% gain. Over that same period, the stock’s industry, Resorts & Casinos, saw a 24.01% gain. That means WYNN that has under-performed its industry as a whole 20.66% since the earnings announcement. Small differences aren’t significant, but when the spread is large it indicates the stock is either much more or much less favored than its group as a whole.
