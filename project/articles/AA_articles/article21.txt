 SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) - Aluminum giant Alcoa Inc. mostly sat out a broader stock market advance Monday after Deutsche Bank cut its rating on the shares and lowered its profit outlook ahead of next week's earnings report.

 stock closed up 3 cents at $14.73 but is down almost 9% since the beginning of the year. 
 Analyst Jorge Beristain downgraded Alcoa to hold from buy and slashed its price target to $18 a share from $25. 
 He blamed "a series of one-off business impacts" that would hurt the company's ability to capitalize on higher aluminum prices. 
 Beristain said he expects a "disappointing" first-quarter report, due to European Union fines along with rising energy and start-up costs. He also cut his 2010 profit outlook by 38% to 64 cents a share and pared his forecast for 2011 to $1.51 a share. 
 For next week's report, Beristain is looking for a profit of 10 cents a share, while the Wall Street consensus calls for 14 cents a share, according to FactSet Research.
