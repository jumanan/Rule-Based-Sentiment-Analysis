The Walt Disney Company<b><font color='red'> has declined a motion</font></b> to add former homosexuals to its sexual orientation and non discrimination policy and diversity training, a measure that would have meant protections for those who have left that lifestyle.Greg Quinlan, director of

</br>
  PFOX , presented the resolution at the recent annual shareholders meeting in San Antonio.But he explains that Disney board chairman John E. Pepper "responded in saying that the current policies were very inclusive and were very broad and that they could not lift every possible nuance to come."
</br>
 But, since the days of Michael Eisner as CEO, several so called "nuances" have been added "where they included transsexuals, transvestites, as well as gay, lesbian and bisexual," Quinlan adds."Transexual, transvestite is...still considered a mental health disorder," he notes.That is also in accordance with the diagnostic manual used by most mental health professionals. But those who have left the homosexual lifestyle are, in effect, placed in a closet, says Quinlan."Well, they don't want to recognize anyone's right of self determination  and that was the point," the PFOX director notes.The resolution did not carry the required three percent vote to be considered again next year, but PFOX does not plan to give up the fight.Quinlan stresses that years ago, many Christians sold their Disney stock out of<b><font color='red'> objection</font></b> to pro homosexual policies, and he believes that Christians ought to retain ownership so they can exercise a more powerful voice in corporate affairs.Connect with Facebook to comment
