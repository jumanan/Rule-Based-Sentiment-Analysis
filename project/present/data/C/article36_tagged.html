</br>
The U.S. currently owns about 27 percent of Citigroup, as part of the biggest bailout of previously ailing banks.Those who having been watching the stock price NYSE: C of Citigroup, however, will note a fact: the stock has been rising.Thus, despite all criticism, it appears the Obama Administration will reap a hefty profit on the bailout.In fact, at today's prices, the sale would amount to a profit of more than $8 billion.This would be the largest profit returned from any bailed out firm; if done in one transaction, it would be the second largest stock sale in history.Only the 1987 stock offering by Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which raised $36.8 billion, would be larger, according to Thomson Reuters.Here's how all this came to pass: in October and November of 2008,  received more than $45 billion in federal aid in exchange for preferred shares.This was later restructured, with $20 billion converted into a loan, and the remaining $25 billion was converted into common stock at the price of $3.25 a share.Those shares have grown in value to $33 billion.Citigroup was the only bank that gave common shares to the government.It was because the firm was in such bad shape that it could not promise to pay back its aid in cash.Much as with anyone who decided to jump on the firms shares when they reached a low of about a dollar, ablut a year ago, the profits of such a sale are marked.Due to the size of the fees on such a deal, other leading financial firms, including Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Goldman Sachs, are lining up to be chosen as the deal's underwriters.In fact, some, such as Goldman Sachs, are offering their services nearly free to the Treasury Department, to boost their chances.Some said that such a result from Citigroup would<b><font color='green'> make the government bailout of trouble financial firms a success</font></b>.Also, once this sale happens, Citigroup would<b><font color='green'> be able</font></b> to<b><font color='red'> cut nearly all of its ties</font></b> to the Troubled Assets Relief Program TARP Neither the federal government or Citigroup commented on the news.Written by Michael Santo
