EPA To Require Beefed Up Labels For Pet Flea, Tick Products
 WASHINGTON Dow Jones The Environmental Protection Agency is requiring beefed up labeling for flea and tick products used on dogs and cats amid an increasing number of reports showing that pets given the pesticides may suffer from seizures and die.The EPA wants companies to make instructions on the products' labels more clear so people don't give their pets too much of the pesticides or give doses intended for cats to dogs and vice versa.The announcement affects most flea and tick products that are applied directly to a pets' skin.These products are widely used each year to prevent pets from getting fleas and ticks, which can carry disease.Companies including Merck & Co.  make these products.They are sold under names such as Frontline Top Spot for Dogs, Promeris Canine Flea Control and Enforcer Flea Drops for Cats.The news comes as the EPA said the number of reports of pets suffering from these products continues to rise.In 2008, the EPA received 44,000 reports of adverse events from these products, a 53% increase from the prior year.The EPA began investigating this issue over a year ago and the industry at the time said people weren't using the products properly.Steve Owens, assistant administrator for EPA's Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances, said the labels are to blame, not consumers."I don't know how you would blame the victim in this case when the label isn't clear," he said in a conference call with reporters Wednesday.Owens said in some instance, people didn't know they need to regulate the dose based on their pet's weight.He said the EPA will require more precise dosing on the product labels.Companies that don't voluntarily update the labels will be forced to, Owens said.Merial Ltd., a joint venture between Merck and Sanofi Aventis SA  , said the number of adverse events related to its popular Frontline products have remained "consistently low since the product's introduction in 1996."  The company said it would work with all pet owners to ensure they use the products properly.Copyright &copy; 2009 Dow Jones Newswires
