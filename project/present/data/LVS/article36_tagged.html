MGM And Pansy Ho Rumors Must Stop
</br>
Every time our various notification systems beep these days it seems it is another story about MGM NYSE:MGM and Pansy Ho, yes I get the irony of writing of another one.It has to be said however that we must have reached the saturation point for this one.There are hollywood A listers that would give their right arm for this amount of coverage and gossip.We need to ask ourselves what would have happened differently had Pansy Ho been an American citizen?Would the naysayers and gossips be able to slander, and yes comment without proof is slander, would they be able to cast aspersions on a persons character like this?Pansy Ho and for that matter her father have never been proven to be linked with or conspiring with any criminal gang.To understand we must take a step back and look at the location.I have been to Hong Kong and Macau many times, I have traveled on Mr Ho’s Ferry service and have seen both the fabulous shiny new Macau and also the older smokier Macau casinos.This is not Las Vegas or Monaco.Anyone who has been will know this.The high roller casino host’s of Las Vegas are replaced by Junket operators whose job it is to bring people to the casino for a share of the revenue.This is a very old tradition in Macau and Las Vegas Sands NYSE:LVS have recently been caught up in<b><font color='red'> allegations</font></b> of<b><font color='red'> criminal behavior</font></b> by one of these junket operators.Is it possible for a casino to be responsible for every single person or company who either recommends or actually brings players to the floor?The Las Vegas Sands issues are it has to be said a little more clear cut than MGM’s but just how liable can the actual casino owner be?Again this is not Las Vegas remember and different practices are what make Macau the mecca it is.Macau has been the only outlet for Asian gambling for over 40 years and is steeped in its own traditions and characters.Just as Las Vegas had the Rat Pack who if you watch any documentary on Las Vegas were very much tied into the Mob.Macau has it’s own characters.Stanley Ho built Macau make no mistake about that, and he did it under very difficult circumstances.Think for a second about having a Chinese population as your customers during the last 40 years of communist Chinese rule.That cannot be an easy thing to do.To say that Stanley Ho and by association his family are unsuitable because they may well know the characters that helped found Macau would be like saying Frank Sinatra was unsuitable as he knew some fairly colorful characters in old Las Vegas.In 2007 the Nevada regulators looking at the same information as the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement concluded that Pansy Ho was indeed sufficiently independent, yet the latter concluded that she is not.Anybody who has spent any time at all in both the west and the east will know beyond doubt that things work differently and to judge one based on the others values cannot work and is highly unfair.MGM have already chosen its side having put it’s 50% stake of the Atlantic City Borgata hotel and casino up for sale and who can blame them.Macau looks to have a bright future where Atlantic City gaming revenues fell 13% last year.To be in Macau you need the best connections and those are almost certainly the Ho’s.So lets hope that this rumor mill finally stops or that if people have actual evidence they put up or shut up.It amazes me that Pansy has managed to remain so very calm and quiet during this onslaught and has not issued writs left right and center but as we said what would have happened if she had been a U.S citizen.What are your thoughts on the U.S holding the rest of the world to their own legal standing?Should they be able to behave this way without showing any evidence what so ever?We do not as a rule leave our musings open for comment due to the huge spam engines that simply swamp the system, we have however left it open on this one.Leave a comment if you have an opinion, the above after all is just my opinion so lets get yours as well and get all sides down, debated and put to rest once and for all, after all there are other news stories to write.Casino Jessie is the in house casino host for Calida Gaming.If it happens in, near or even slightly related to a casino she is on it.With Casino Jessie and Calida's 84 years of Industry experience how can you go wrong?Visit Authors Website
