J Crew Group‚Äôs price target was raised from $49.00 to $50.00 citing data from J. Crew‚Äôs fourth quarter earnings report which was released last night.The stock opened down about 2% today following the results.J.Crew Group, Inc is a multi channel specialty retailer in the United States that sells style conscious clothing.Citibank expects the company to report 2011 earninsg per share of $2.30 versus the consensus estimate of $2.14.Analyst Kimberly Greenberger, said, &#8220;We find 4Q09&#8217;s +17% comp, +13% direct growth & +1,630bps gross margin impressive; however, JCG shares have moved ~+44% since 8/27/09.Although we continue to see ~+6% upside to our new $50 price target raised from $49 we prefer a pullback before contemplating a commitment of new capital.We expect continued solid execution & believe 1Q10 EPS guidance is conservative, but the stock at 20.4x 2010E and 17.4x 2011E likely discounts much of the good news.Historically high operating margins we expect 16% in &#8216;11 , modest N T square ft. growth ~+3% in 2010 , & flattish 2H10E EPS growth could hold the shares back.&#8221;
