NYSE: AMD believe that customers in the developing countries will favor more branded computers, particularly, portable laptops, in the future.Currently, branded computer makers monopolize the laptop market, whose sales data are easily to forecast.Hewlett Packard Company NYSE: HPQ , Toshiba Corporation, Dell Inc. Nasdaq: DELL and Apple Inc. Nasdaq: AAPL all publicize their operation data for the analysis of market research firms.If global brands cannot foray into the burgeoning market at once, powerful local companies will gear up, like Lenovo Group Limited SEHK: 0992 ,<b><font color='lime'> used to be a partner of Intel in China</font></b>, currently the world's fourth largest computer maker.USD 1 = CNY 6.83 Source: news.ccidnet.com March 29, 2010 For full details on Intel Corp INTC .Intel Corp INTC has Short Term PowerRatings at TradingMarkets.Details on Intel Corp INTC Short Term PowerRatings is available at Learn new strategies, how to trade in this market, and the stocks you should be focusing on each day.Join us for our  20 minute tele seminars during the week.Thursday April 29 12:30 PM Hear What Kevin Haggerty Sees in the Stock Market Today!Wednesday April 28 01:00 PM Hear What Gary Kaltbaum Sees in the Stock Market Today!* Attendance is strictly limited and are filled on a first come, first served basis.
