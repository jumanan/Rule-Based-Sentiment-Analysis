Statement by Robert A. Iger, President and CEO, The Walt Disney Company, on the Passing of Fess Parker
)--Robert A. Iger, President and CEO, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), issued the following statement: 
 &#8220;Like many kids growing up in the 50&#8217;s, Davy Crockett was my first hero, and I had the coonskin cap to prove it. Fess Parker&#8217;s unforgettable, exciting and admirable performance as this American icon has remained with me all these years, as it has for his millions of fans around the world. Fess is truly a Disney Legend, as is the heroic character he portrayed, and while he will certainly be missed, he will never be forgotten.&#8221;
