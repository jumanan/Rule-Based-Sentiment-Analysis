 March 15, 2010 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time Portola Pharmaceuticals and Merck Announce that Phase 2 Study Showed Investigational Factor Xa Inhibitor, Betrixaban, Reduced Incidence of Bleeding Compared to Warfarin in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation
</br>
 Portola Pharmaceuticals and Merck today announced the results of EXPLORE Xa, a Phase 2 exploratory, dose finding study of betrixaban, an investigational oral direct Factor Xa inhibitor.Results showed that a once daily dose of oral betrixaban, given to patients with non valvular atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and at least one risk factor for stroke, reduced the incidence of major and clinically relevant non major CRNM bleeds
</br>
 compared to dose adjusted warfarin.The data were presented during a late breaking clinical trials session at the American College of Cardiology ACC 59
</br>
 Annual Scientific Session in Atlanta.&#8220;Given that bleeding can be a significant safety issue for patients who take warfarin, there is a critical unmet need for anticoagulant therapy options&#8221;
</br>
 "Given that bleeding can be a significant safety issue for patients who take warfarin, there is a critical unmet need for anticoagulant therapy options," said U.S. national coordinator in the study, Michael Ezekowitz, MB, ChB, DPhil, vice president of the Lankenau Institute for Medical Research and professor at Jefferson Medical College."The EXPLORE Xa study accomplished its objective of providing important information to guide the betrixaban dosing strategy for future investigational studies."  In this multinational, dose finding study of 508 patients with non valvular atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and at least one risk factor for stroke, a once daily dose of betrixaban 40 mg n=127 demonstrated significantly less major and CRNM bleeding than open label warfarin n=127, p=0.035 .The risk of major and CRNM bleeding for the 60 mg n=127 and 80 mg n=127 doses of betrixaban was similar to warfarin.About the EXPLORE Xa Study
</br>
 The Phase 2b randomized, parallel group study examined three blinded doses of betrixaban compared with open label, dose adjusted warfarin in 508 patients with non valvular atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and at least one risk factor for stroke.Patients ranged from ages 46 to 91 and a total of 87 percent previously received a vitamin K antagonist.Participants were not excluded for severe renal impairment, except those on dialysis.One hundred and twenty seven patients were randomized to each of four treatment groups: betrixaban 40, 60 or 80 mg or open label warfarin INR 2 3 , the current standard of care.The study was conducted in 35 centers in the U.S., Canada and Germany with a minimum follow up of three months and a maximum of 12 months.The goal of the study was to assess the safety and tolerability of betrixaban compared to warfarin to provide information to guide further clinical development.The primary study endpoint was the time to occurrence of major or CRNM bleeding.The incidence crude rates of major or CRNM bleeding was 0.8 percent, 3.9 percent, 3.9 percent and 5.5 percent for the betrixaban 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg and warfarin groups, respectively.The secondary endpoints included the time to occurrence of any bleeding major, CRNM, and minimal and the time to occurrence of death, stroke ischemic or hemorrhagic , myocardial infarction, or other systemic embolism.The incidence crude rates of any bleeding was significantly lower compared to warfarin 31.5 percent for patients taking betrixaban 40 mg 17.3 percent, p=0.011 and 80 mg 18.9 percent, p=0.022 ; but not those taking betrixaban 60 mg 25.2 percent, p=0.309 .The number of events in the secondary composite endpoint of death, stroke, myocardial infarction or other systemic embolism ranged from 0 1 in each of the four dosing groups, which was the expected stroke/embolic event rate for the warfarin control group.There was one stroke each in the betrixaban 60 mg and 80 mg groups, and one death each in the betrixaban 40 mg and warfarin groups.There were no myocardial infarctions or other systemic emboli in any of the four dosing groups.The most common adverse events in the betrixaban groups combined n=381 were diarrhea 6 percent versus 0.8 percent on warfarin ; nausea 5.5 percent versus 1.6 percent on warfarin ; constipation 5.2 percent versus 2.4 percent on warfarin ; headache 5.2 percent versus 2.4 percent on warfarin and peripheral edema 6.8 percent versus 7.9 percent on warfarin .A numerically higher percentage of patient discontinuations occurred in each of the three betrixaban groups than in the open label warfarin group 8.7 9.4 percent vs. 6.3 percent .Today's Merck is working to help the world be well.Through our medicines, vaccines, biologic therapies, and consumer and animal products, we work with customers and operate in more than 140 countries to deliver innovative health solutions.We also demonstrate our commitment to increasing access to health care through far reaching programs that donate and deliver our products to the people who need them.Merck.Be Well.For more information, visit About Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
