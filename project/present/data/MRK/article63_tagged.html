MedZilla also reported increases in candidate searches for nurses up more than five percent.The candidate search information was very encouraging for job seekers in Georgia, where companies increased their search efforts by more than ten percent.Several others were up by 2.5 to 3.5 percent.On the other end of the spectrum, though, were Massachusetts, California, and New Jersey where Merck is headquartered where searches<b><font color='red'> dropped by four</font></b> to five percent overall.And activity by job seekers themselves remained flat, as it has for several months."As companies begin hiring again, it becomes more important than ever for job seekers http://www.medzilla.com to make sure their information is up to date," said John Burkhardt, MedZilla's Operations Director.He recommended checking resumes, job boards, and even social networking sites to ensure they had the most recent information."With so many qualified candidates, it's a major mistake to ignore the possible consequences of what you've been doing in your spare time.And despite what you may think, if you're getting an interview, they're going to check your Facebook." In January, PCWorld.com spoke to a major job board whose research indicated more than half of employers check social networking sites, and about 40 percent had declined to hire an applicant because of what they found about him or her.The biggest culprits were indiscreet comments and provocative images."It sounds silly, but if it's not something you could show your grandmother, it's not something you should be posting, especially if you're looking for a new job."
