 this morning raised his rating on  to Buy from Neutral, lifting his price target to 14.50 Euros from 10.50 or in greenbacks, to $19.55, from $14.16.&#8220;We believe Nokia&#8217;s current valuation implies no value to its ability to transition consumers into Nokia service subscribers,&#8221; he writes in a research note.Jenkins adds that the company is &#8220;well placed&#8221; to benefit from the growth of the smart phone market, which he sees expanding 34% in units in 2010, with 25% growth in revenue.&#8220;Nokia is one of few vendors who can profitably<b><font color='red'> offer lower</font></b> priced smart phones for the emerging markets,&#8221; he<b><font color='red'> contends</font></b>.&#8220;Nokia&#8217;s scale is likely to result in it continuing to be a major player in smart phones longer term and this will<b><font color='green'> be enhanced as smart phones</font></b><b><font color='red'> move down the price curve</font></b>.On a short term note, Jenkins says that his checks indicate &#8220;a strong Q1&#8243; for Nokia in volume, mix and pricing.Jenkins lifts his EPS forecast for the company to 82 Euro cents a share from 76 cents for this year, and to 99 Euro cents from 84 cents for next year.NOK is up 8 cents, or 0.5%, at $15.64.Tech Trader Daily HOME PAGE
