Here are highlights from Thursday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:
Initial Jobless Claims Down Again
 Extended claims are very helpful from a humanitarian point of view at a time when there are five job seekers for every job opening.By the time people have been out of work for six months, it is highly likely that they have already drawn down their savings and run up their credit cards.That probably includes drawing on 401 k accounts.When people do that, the money withdrawn is taxable, and they have to pay a 10% penalty.With one out of four homeowners with mortgages now underwater and millions more extremely close to &#8220;sea level,&#8221; the option of drawing on home equity is not open the way it had been in previous downturns.Thus without a paycheck, these people are left with no financial resources at all.That is clearly a severe hardship on the families involved.However, it is also very bad news for the economy overall.The money from extended benefits tends to get spent quickly and spent on basic necessities.This means they can buy their groceries and other basic goods at  instead of having to rely on already overstretched food banks.That helps keep people working at Wal Mart.If they spend the money on toilet paper, it helps keep people working at Procter & Gamble
 Those people who are kept working in turn go out and spend money and keep other people working.In fact, the non partisan Congressional Budget Office CBO finds that, dollar for dollar, extended claims is among the most effective form of fiscal stimulus in keeping of creating jobs.Boost for Bristol Myers
