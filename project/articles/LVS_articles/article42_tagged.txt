Las Vegas Sands LVS Honored For Training Efforts
Las Vegas Sands LVS As the Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem readies for the implementation of table games owner Las Vegas Sands Corp  understands the importance of aiding those who develop gambling addictions.“Continued gambling addiction training is especially important as the casino prepares to add table games in July,” Sands Bethlehem President Robert DeSalvio said Thursday, &#8220;It&#8217;s a good opportunity to double back these efforts.&#8221;
This week Sands sponsored its fifth training session in the past three years to train counselors and social workers on how to handle the issue.While all Pennsylvania casinos must have a state approved problem gambling plan, Nanette Horner, director of the state&#8217;s Office of Compulsive and Problem Gambling said &#8220;Sands has really embraced training.They started these programs even before their license was awarded.&#8221; The Council on Compulsive Gambling has even honored the gaming company for their training efforts both statewide and nationally.Sands Bethlehem held its first local gambling training course in November 2006 and did not receive its gaming license until the following month.According to Jim Pappas, executive director for the state&#8217;s compulsive gambling council more than 400 counselors in the Lehigh Valley and Scranton areas have completed 30 hours of problem gambling training, the highest amount in the state.Join the forum discussion of this news story
