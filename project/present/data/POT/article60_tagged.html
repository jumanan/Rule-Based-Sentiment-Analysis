Expecting<b><font color='green'> reduced volatility in Potash NYSE</font></b>: POT Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan NYSE: POT sees long term call spread action  by Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan NYSE:  shares were little changed yesterday, losing 51 cents, or less than half of one percent.But this lack of excitement is exactly what some options players are hoping for, and inspired a large ratio call spread in the shares.Around noon Eastern Time on Tuesday, an options trader bought 3,500 of the January 2012 140 calls for $15.35 per contract and sold 5,000 January 160 calls for $9.55 each.In terms of total premium, the trader paid $5.372 million for the 140 strike calls and collected $4.775 million for the 160 strike positions, resulting in an overall net debit of roughly $600,000.Typically when we show profit/loss diagrams

It is more likely that this is more of a volatility play than a directional one.The disparate long and short positions make the delta effect very small i.e., the spread will be little changed on any move in POT shares themselves .The vega effect, however, is notable.At current levels, this position&#8217;s value – all other things held equal – will change by $70,000 for every one point drop in implied volatility.Since early November, POT shares have been bouncing around between the 100 and 125 levels, but implied volatilities have been declining steadily since early February.If this trend continues, the ratio spread buyer should see positive results.Potash Corp./Saskatchewan NYSE:<b><font color='red'> POT iron condor Limited</font></b> downside in Potash NYSE: POT ?More in Need to Know Basis
