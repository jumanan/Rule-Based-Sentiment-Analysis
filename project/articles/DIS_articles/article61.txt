Walt Disney (DIS) Could Hit New 52-Week High This Week
Posted: Monday, March 15, 2010 9:11 AM EDT 
Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) ended the last trading session at $33.69. So far the stock has hit a 52-week low of $17.01 and 52-week high of $33.81. Walt Disney stock has been showing support around 33.32 and resistance in the 34.00 range. Technical indicators for the stock are Bullish and S&P gives DIS a positive 4 STAR (out of 5) buy rating. DIS appears on the Investors Observer Analysts Favorites list. For a hedged play on this stock, look at a Jul '10 35 covered call for a net debit in the $32.53 area. That is also the break even stock price for this trade. This covered call has a 124 day duration, provides 3.44% downside protection and a 7.59% assigned return rate for a 22.35% annualized return rate (comparison purposes only). A lower cost hedged play for this stock would use a longer term call option in place of the covered call stock purchase. To use this strategy look at going long the DIS Jan '11 25 Call and selling the Jul '10 35 call for an $8.24 debit. The trade has a 124 day life and would provide 1.34% downside protection and a 21.36% assigned return rate for a 63.00% annualized return rate (for comparison purposes only). Walt Disney has a current annual dividend yield of 1.05%. [ABR-Seven Summits Research]
