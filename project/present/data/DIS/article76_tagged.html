 By Donna Kardos  Updates with additional company information, beginning in the seventh paragraph.NEW YORK MarketWatch U.S. stocks climbed Thursday, lifting the Standard & Poor's 500 to a 17 month high as bullish comments from Citigroup's chief executive lifted the financial sector and boosted investor sentiment for a broad range of companies including Walt Disney and Home Depot.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 44.51 points, or 0.42%, to 10611.84, marking its third straight day higher and its highest closing level since Jan. 19.Disney was one of its best performers,<b><font color='green'> up 48</font></b> cents, or 1.4%, to $33.81, along with Home Depot, which climbed 42 cents, or 1.3%, to 32.13.The gains across those stocks and others came as Citigroup Chief Executive Vikram Pandit forecast at a conference that the bank's returns on assets in its core business would grow slightly this year.The projection boosted the shares of Citigroup which was still settling recently but looked to be up about 24 cents, or 6.1%, to 4.20 along with the mood across Wall Street.Citigroup isn't a Dow component.The Nasdaq Composite rose 9.51, or 0.40%, to 2368.46, its highest close since Aug. 28, 2008.The Standard & Poor's 500 index advanced 4.63, or 0.40%, to 1150.24, its highest close since Oct. 1, 2008.The financial sector led its gains, followed by consumer discretionary stocks.Thursday's gains marked the Dow's biggest move since Friday, as this week has been marked by lower volume and smaller movements.While some have said the lower volume is a cause for concern, Peter Misek, market strategist and director of research at Canaccord Adams, remains confident in his bullish stance."There's a great saying, 'never short a dull market,'" Misek said."You get these dull markets at economic turning points," he said, noting that while investors have been pleased to see incremental improvements in the economy, they have also been concerned about how it will be affected if the Federal Reserve has to raise interest rates later this year.These two competing forces recently have limited the size of the stock market's movements."When we get equilibrium between those two factors, we'll probably move higher," Misek added.Arch Coal rose 41 cents, or 1.6%, to 25.52, after the coal company acquired a 35% interest in the Trailblazer Energy Center, a clean fossil fuel power plant being developed by Tenaska Inc. in Texas.Dr Pepper Snapple advanced 1.38, or 4.1%, to 35.03, after UBS upgraded its investment rating on the soft drink company's stock to buy from neutral and lifted its price target to $42 from $31.The firm said it doesn't believe the market is fully valuing strong fundamentals for the business as well as a rapid current and pending share repurchase program.Level 3 Communications Nasdaq advanced 5 cents, or 3.2%, to 1.63, after J.P. Morgan raised its investment rating on the telecom and information services company's stock, saying Level 3 should benefit from improved sentiment as enterprise spending resumes.Western Digital rose 79 cents, or 2.1%, to 38.86.Craig Hallum cut its investment rating on the stock to accumulate from buy, saying that in the near term the data storage company will be susceptible to above average trading volatility.Boston Scientific edged up 21 cents, or 2.8%, to 7.86.The medical device company said U.S. regulators approved its stent designed for pelvis artery disease, which Boston Scientific plans to launch immediately in the U.S.CA Inc. Nasdaq edged up 6 cents, or 0.3%, to 22.66, after the business software maker said it would pay $350 million in cash to acquire privately held Nimsoft.The move underscores CA's efforts to expand its sales with smaller and mid sized companies and buttress its cloud computing products.Shares of GameStop leapt 1.07, or 5.9%, to 19.35, on speculation the videogame retailer might be a takeover target, though analysts questioned the validity of the day's chatter.While there were no specific details about possible suitors or an imminent deal, rumors swirled that a private equity firm might be interested in the company.Sears starts to look like a retailer again
