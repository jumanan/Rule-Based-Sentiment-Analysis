Potash NYSE: POT call buyer
</br>
During midday trading, Potash investors load up on upside calls and sell stock simultaneously
</br>
 by Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. NYSE:  are roughly 5% off their 52 week high of $128 reached in mid March.In morning trading today, the whole agricultural chemical sector is up slightly, and POT is going along for the ride, trading around $121.There isn&#8217;t any concrete news that pushed the sector higher, but it is rallying with the broader market.A look at some call buying might suggest an investors placed a bet on later term upside.Around 11 a.m. EST this morning, an investor purchased 10,000 June 125 calls versus current open interest of 16,816.The investors paid $7.85 for the calls when the stock was trading around $121.I like to use my  virtual trading account to look at the profit and loss potential for trades like this long call.At first glance, this trade appears very bullish; it probably is.But a closer look shows that these options traded with stock, meaning that the call buyer simultaneously sold shares to the option market makers.A look at the time and sales in POT shows that 480,000 shares traded at $121.25 around the time of the option trade, so 480,000 is roughly the number of shares that market makers would need to buy to make this trade delta neutral.The fact that the investor executed a delta neutral trade could mean that they are more interested in betting on volatility than direction.The $7.85 premium in the calls with stock at $121.25 is an implied volatility of 40.5%.The historical volatility for the last three months is 38%.If this investor thinks that POT will become more volatile, then purchasing options on an implied volatility of 40.5% will make money for the investor if they are hedged daily until expiration.I think, however, that it is more likely that this trade is either still bullish or that the investor is buying the options to close risk.This is because I think that the investor has sold the stock to the option market makers to control the price jump in the stock caused by the market makers buying the stock in the open market.By doing so, the investor has managed to only purchase volatility from the market makers rather than delta.This enables the investor to get a cheaper options price because the option market makers do not have to take stock price risk at the time of the option sale.This action allows the investor to keep the purchase of the stock more anonymous.The investor may have bought the stock in the market prior to buying the calls hoping that the price paid for the shares will be less than what would be implied in the option price.The investor then sells the stock to the market makers and is left with the long calls.The bull case for POT is reasonable, so I can see why an investor would want to try to own some calls for a rebound, or at least cover short calls.We will find out on Monday morning when open interest is published if it was opening or closing.If the open interest is flat or has declined, then the buyer was likely closing a short from a time when implied volatility in POT was higher.More in Volatility Overlays
