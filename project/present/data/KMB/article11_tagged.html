Posted on 03/26/10 at 11:52am by The Dow Jones Industrial Average  is quickly approaching 11,000.In fact, the Dow is up 4.95% for the month of March.The S&P 500  is currently up 5.72% during March.Do these gains have you exuberant or worried?For me, when gains come very quickly, I tend to get worried.Therefore, if you're looking to lock in some gains, it may be time to shift to less risky, dividend plays, instead of high beta cyclicals.Some names to consider are:
</br>
 , which yields 4.20% and has paid a dividend for 422 consecutive quarters.Altria Group NYSE:  , the well known cigarette manufacturer, currently yields 6.80%.The company has a policy to return 75% of earnings to shareholders in the form of cash distributions.Kimberly Clark Corporation NYSE:  , the maker of Kleenex and other personal care products, has paid dividends since 1935 and yields 4.20%.offers a current yield of 3.30%, the lowest of the group, but is arguably the fastest growing dividend play here and its business is currently firing on all cyclinders.These are just some ideas to get you started.If you think risky assets may be due for a pullback, it never hurts to take money off the table and get some income on the side.Bookmark/Search this post with: You are not watching this post, click to start watching
