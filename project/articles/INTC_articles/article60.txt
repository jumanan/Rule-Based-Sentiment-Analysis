Intel Launches Its Most Secure Data Center Processor
Second-Generation High-K Metal Gate 32nm Processors Blend Security, Performance, Energy Efficiency
SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(
)--Combining unprecedented security, performance and energy efficiency, Intel Corporation today launched the Intel&#174; Xeon&#174; Processor 5600 series. The new processors deliver two new security features -- 
 Advanced Encryption Standard New Instructions (Intel
Intel&#174; Trusted Execution Technology (Intel
 -- that enable faster encryption and decryption performance for more secure transactions and virtualized environments, providing data centers with a stronger foundation for cloud security. 
&#8220;We take advantage of the increased core count on the Intel Core i7-980X by adding greater animation detail to fighting units on both land and sea, allowing the game to have higher visual fidelity.&#8221;
 These are also the first server and workstation chips based on the groundbreaking, new Intel 32nm logic technology, which uses Intel&#8217;s second-generation high-k metal gate transistors to increase speed and decrease energy consumption. The Intel Xeon Processor 5600 series supports up to six cores per processor and delivers up to 60 percent greater performance than the 45nm Intel Xeon processor 5500 series. In addition, data centers can replace 15 single-core servers with a single new one, and achieve a return on their investment in as little as 5 months. 
 Data centers will also benefit from the power efficiency of the Intel Xeon processor 5600 series. A two-socket server using the new low-voltage Intel Xeon processor L5640 can deliver the same performance as a server using the previous generation&#8217;s champion; the Intel Xeon processors X5570 series, but with up to 30 percent lower platform power.

 &#8220;The Intel Xeon Processor 5600 series will be the backbone of mainstream computing environments,&#8221; said Kirk Skaugen, vice president and general manager of the Intel Architecture Group. &#8220;New security capabilities will boost the confidence of IT managers. Improvements in performance, server virtualization and power consumption will foster productivity and efficiency for a broad range of applications ranging from data transactions to workstations performing medical imaging and digital prototyping.&#8221; 
 With emerging threats, new architectures and an ever-changing regulatory environment, security is an increasing concern for IT managers, and often an impediment to deploying more advanced computing infrastructures. The Intel Xeon processor 5600 series addresses these issues with features that help ensure greater data integrity. 
 The Intel Xeon processor 5600 series includes Intel AES-NI, a new set of instructions first introduced with the new 2010 Intel&#174; Core&#174; processor family. These instructions accelerate AES performance to enable faster data encryption and decryption for a wide range of applications such as database encryption features, full disk encryption and secure internet transactions. 
 Intel TXT will provide added security that cloud environments have been waiting for by enabling a more secure platform launch environment, along with providing more protection for applications that move between virtualized servers. Hardware-based capabilities integrated into the processor shield against malicious software to allow important applications and data to run more securely in a virtualized environment. 
 Working together, Intel TXT and Intel AES can ensure that virtualized environments experience better performance and functionality, and are more secure when they are launched, migrated or at rest. 
More Performance, Less Energy
 The security of the Intel Xeon processor 5600 series is matched by performance, versatility and energy efficiency that will help increase the efficiency of data center operations. Technologies such as 
Intel&#174; Turbo Boost Technology
Intel&#174; Hyper-Threading Technology
Intel&#174; Virtualization Technology (VT)
 adjust to the performance requirements of users, enhance multitasking and increase the reliability and manageability of consolidated IT environments. 
 The frequency-optimized quad-core version of the Intel Xeon processor 5600 series peaks at 3.46 GHz with a TDP of 130 watts, while the six-core version reaches 3.33 GHz with a TDP of 130 watts. Advanced six-core versions will top out at 2.93 GHz and TDP of 95 watts, and the standard quad-core processor will reach 2.66 GHz at 80 watts. Low voltage versions of the chip will have TDPs as low as 60 watts and 40 watts and feature six and four cores respectively. 
 Intel also announced the availability of the Intel&#174; Xeon&#174; processor L3406 series. Targeted for use in the single processor micro server segment, the Intel Xeon processor L3406 series has a TDP of only 30 watts, making it ideal for high-density form factors and power-sensitive environments.
