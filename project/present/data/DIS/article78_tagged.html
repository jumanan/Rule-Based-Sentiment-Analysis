What Moves Stock Prices During a Merger?by John Jagerson, Analyst at The closing prices at the time of the deal meant that Marvel shareholders would have gotten $49.3998 per share in value for their stock at closing.However, the when the merger was announced the per share price of Marvel Entertainment, Inc was actually only $48.37 a full point below the merger value.One of the things we look for when watching for a market bottom is an increase in merger and acquisition M&A activity.Lower stock prices are attractive to potential acquirers as they look to consolidate competitors and grab more market share.2010 may be a great year for this kind of activity if volatility begins to fall.STOCK PRICES CAN CHANGE EVEN AFTER A MERGER IS ANNOUNCED
</br>
A common question relative to M&A activity and its affect on stock prices is why the acquisition target's stock price does not equal the value the acquirer will be paying.In other words if company A is buying Company B's stock for $10 a share in a few months, why doesn't Company B's stock equal $10 now?UNCERTAINTY LOWERS PRICES
</br>
The differential between an M&A target's acquisition price per share and its current trading price accounts for the uncertainty around the merger.Although it is rare, if the purchase never actually happens, the target's stock will likely drop significantly.In the video, I will cover a specific case study that you can see in the market today.HOSTILE TAKEOVERS ARE EVEN MORE UNCERTAIN
</br>
The more uncertain the actual merger is, the wider this delta or differential will be.For example, if the target company is being subjected to a hostile or unsolicited takeover the difference between the acquisition stock price and the current stock price will be very wide as management works to fend off the acquirer or attract a "white knight" to rescue it from the larger firm.THINK BEFORE TRADING
</br>
It may be tempting to take advantage of this differential by buying the target's stock and shorting the proper ratio of the acquirer's stock.That strategy has a very poor risk/reward ratio as the downside can be many times the possible upside.Long Term Capital Management the trillion dollar hedge fund bailed out by the Fed in the late 1990's famously built a problematic portfolio of leveraged versions of this trade.OPTIONS MAY BE A BETTER ALTERNATIVE
</br>
Alternatively, buying long term puts on the target's stock may be another way to approach the opportunity.This strategy is extremely speculative but the upside could be very large should the merger not occur.Browse All Directories &gt;&gt;
