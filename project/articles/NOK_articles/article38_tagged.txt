&laquo; Back to &#8220;Note of the Day &mdash; A Collection of Ideas&#8221;<b><font color='green'> Unlicensed Mobile Phone Vendors<b><font color='red'> Could Hurt Nokia&</font></b></font></b>#8217;s Emerging Markets Business
March 23rd, 2010 by  NYSE:NOK , in its recent ,<b><font color='red'> has revised its historical mobile phone market share down</font></b> based on new information that suggests Nokia<b><font color='red'> is increasingly competing with unlicensed</font></b> and<b><font color='red'> illegal</font></b> &#8220;gray market&#8221; mobile phone vendors in emerging markets particularly in Asia .  Below we highlight how further market share losses attributable to gray market vendors could negatively impact our estimate for Nokia&#8217;s stock by about 8<b><font color='red'> % Downward Revision</font></b> of Nokia Market Share
Nokia<b><font color='red'> lowered its market share figure for 2009 from 38 %</font></b> claimed in its previous report to 34%.  We have updated our analysis of Nokia to reflect this and the change has resulted in a slight decrease of the Trefis price estimate for Nokia&#8217;s stock
 from $25.96 to $25.85.  Gray market vendors<b><font color='red'> are a particular concern for Nokia since the company&</font></b>#8217;s emerging markets business constitutes around 71% of Nokia&#8217;s stock
,<b><font color='red'> meaning that the loss of Nokia market share in emerging markets</font></b> can have a significant impact on the company&#8217;s stock.Chinese Gray Market Was 44% Last Year
, gray market mobile phone shipments in China grew from around 101 million in 2008 to around 145 million in 2009.  This constitutes around 19% of  all mobile phones sold in emerging markets China, India, Brazil  in 2009.  Low cost gray market phones will make it harder for Nokia, which<b><font color='red'> is already losing market share</font></b>, to compete in emerging markets.<b><font color='red'> Nokia Already Losing Market</font></b> Share in Emerging Markets
We have estimated that Nokia’s share in emerging markets
 was around 40% in 2009 and could<b><font color='red'> decline to 37 % by the end of Trefis forecast period</font></b>, led by increasing competition from Samsung, LG, Further Loss of 4% Share Would Mean $2 Downside to Nokia’s Stock
If the gray market in China and other Asian markets continue to grow rapidly, this could lead to a substantial downside to Nokia’s stock price.  If Nokia<b><font color='red'> were to lose a further 4 % share</font></b> to the gray market and reach 33% share by the end of Trefis forecast period instead of 37% as we have estimated, this will lead to a downside of $2 8% for the $26 Trefis price estimate for Nokia’s stock
You can modify our forecasts  to see how Nokia’s stock would be impacted if its market share<b><font color='red'> were to decline at a faster rate than we</font></b> forecast.For additional analysis and forecasts, here is our complete model for Nokia&#8217;s stock
