CORRECT:2nd UPDATE: Aegis Appoints Jerry Buhlmann CEO
 "=2nd UPDATE: Aegis Appoints Jerry Buhlman CEO; Sees Modest Growth" published at 1238 GMT incorrectly spelled the last name of the new CEO in the headline and throughout the story.The error was also contained in the item "=UPDATE: Aegis Appoints Jerry Buhlman CEO; Sees Modest Growth" published at 1007 GMT and the item "=Aegis Appoints Jerry Buhlman CEO; Sees Modest Growth" published at 0735 GMT as well as a flash published at 0812 GMT".The correct version follows:  PARIS Dow Jones Aegis Group PLC AGS.LN Thursday appointed company insider Jerry Buhlmann to take the helm of the U.K. based advertising and marketing firm 16 months after the previous chief executive left, as it forecast a return to modest organic revenue growth after a prolonged industry slump.Buhlmann, currently head of the group's marketing services division Aegis Media, will officially take over May 1, replacing interim CEO John Napier.Prior to his current role, Buhlmann led Aegis's media buying arm Carat International for three years and was CEO of Aegis Media for Europe, Middle East and Africa.The appointment of Buhlmann puts an end to a long period of uncertainty about the group's strategy, analysts said.Exane BNP Paribas' Charles Bedouelle said the appointment of Buhlmann is positive given that he is a "strong operating executive" and "Aegis clearly needs a 'hands on' CEO." Exane rates Aegis neutral.Still, at 1211 GMT, Aegis's shares were trading down 2.7% to 124 pence as analysts were surprised by a convertible bond offer of approximately GBP170 million, due in 2015, which it said would be used to strengthen its balance sheet and for acquisitions.Some analysts also noted a disappointment that with the management situation clarified, a tie up with French rival Havas SA HAV.FR now seems more unlikely.Indeed, Napier said there are currently no talks with Havas about any tie up, a source of persistent market speculation partly because Vincent Bollore, the French industrialist and Havas' chairman, also owns nearly 30% of Aegis."The convertible bond launch may be a further sign that the group wants to pursue its own agenda, separate from Havas," Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a research note.The bank has a neutral rating on Aegis.Napier, who will remain chairman, said the group sees the opportunity to make smaller acquisitions this year and hopes to expand its presence in the U.S. and China.He also laid out a platform for Buhlman's tenure as he forecast a return to modest organic revenue growth this year.He said Aegis is well placed to face the continuing challenges in 2010 as the strong run of new business wins in the second half of 2009 continued into January and February.Aegis media won net new business worth $2.7 billion in 2009, winning deals from clients including Nokia Corp.  and BMX AG BMX.XE , up from $900 million won in 2008."The world outlook, although improved, is still very patchy and has elements of uncertainty.Despite this we see ourselves well placed to resume modest growth," Aegis said in a statement.Organic revenue, a closely watched metric in the advertising industry that strips out currency effects, acquisitions and disposals, fell 9.7% last year.In common with peers, the rate of decline slowed in the fourth quarter to a drop of 6.9% from a drop of 11.1% in the third quarter.Five analysts polled by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast Aegis' full year organic revenue to drop 10.4%.Total revenue for the year was GBP1.35 billion, up slightly from GBP1.34 billion posted in 2008, boosted by a weaker sterling versus the dollar and euro and exactly meeting analysts' forecasts.Net profit in the year ended Dec. 31 was GBP62.7 million, compared with GBP82.8 million a year ago, hit by restructuring charges.Aegis started to cut staff and other costs already in 2008 and continued in 2009 to try and meet falling revenues as clients cutting advertising budgets amid the downturn.Adjusted operating profit fell 3.8% in the year to GBP170.3 million, above analysts' forecast of GBP166.1 million.The adjusted figure exclude items such as profits and losses on disposals of investments, amortization of purchased intangible assets, and tax items.The group's adjusted operating margin in 2009 was 12.6% versus 13.2% in 2008.The owner of Europe's biggest media buying agency Carat and digital planning group Isobar, said it will pay a dividend of 2.5 pence a share for 2009, stable from last year.Copyright &copy; 2009 Dow Jones Newswires
