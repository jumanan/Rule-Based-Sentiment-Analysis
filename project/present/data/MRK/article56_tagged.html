'91 Memo Warned of Mercury in Shots
</br>
 A memo from Merck & Co. shows that, nearly a decade before the first public disclosure, senior executives<b><font color='red'> were concerned that infants</font></b> were getting an elevated dose of mercury in vaccinations containing a widely used sterilizing agent.The March 1991 memo, obtained by The Times, said that 6 month old children who received their shots on schedule would get a mercury dose up to 87 times higher than guidelines for the maximum daily consumption of mercury from fish.H1N1 vaccine a tough sell to pregnant women
</br>
As the H1N1 influenza vaccine trickles into clinics and pharmacies over the next few weeks, public health officials and doctors desperately hope that pregnant women will be at the front of the line for the shot.Past influenza pandemics have proved that they're at increased risk for severe complications and they appear to be even more vulnerable to this new flu strain.On Thursday, a consortium of major medical groups, including the American Medical Assn., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, released a statement pleading with pregnant women to get both the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines.Experimental Vaccine Shows Promise Against Lymphoma
</br>
 An experimental vaccine tested on four lymphoma patients has shown promise in treating the lymph cancer, scientists said Friday.The vaccine is for non Hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of lymph cancer that occurs when disease fighting antibodies known as B cells grow out of control."The finding shows that we can induce lymphoma patients to have an immune response," said Dr.

Study bolsters hopes for prostate cancer vaccine rejected by FDA
</br>
 A controversial prostate cancer vaccine that previously had been rejected by the Food and Drug Administration improves survival of patients with the advanced form of the disease more than existing treatments and should be brought to market, researchers said Tuesday.Research can't link autism, mercury
</br>
 The prevalence of autism in California children continued to rise after most vaccine manufacturers started to remove the mercury based preservative thimerosal in 1999, suggesting that the chemical was not a primary cause of the disorder, according to a study released Monday.The analysis found that from 2004 to 2007, when exposure to thimerosal dropped significantly for 3 to 5 year olds, the autism rate continued to increase in that group from 3.0 to 4.1 per 1,000 children.Pneumonia vaccine may help limit swine flu deaths
</br>
 In years past, the nation's attempts to prevent flu related deaths have focused on limiting transmission of the virus through widespread vaccination programs.This year, with school starting up well before a vaccine for the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus will be available, there will be little that can slow the spread of the virus for the next few months.Vaccines for drug addiction show promise
</br>

</br>
Vaccines to help people recover from such addictions as nicotine, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamines now appear scientifically and medically achievable after doctors reported Monday that a vaccine to treat cocaine dependence had produced a large enough antibody response to reduce cocaine use in 38% of addicted individuals.Those results come on the heels of last week's announcement that the federal government would fund a large clinical trial of a nicotine vaccine based on earlier promising studies.Most California voters don't plan to get swine flu vaccine, Times/USC poll finds

</br>
As concern spreads about H1N1 flu, a new survey of California voters found that while most consider the vaccine safe, a majority had no plans to get vaccinated.The poll also found that blacks and Latinos are far more likely than other groups to say they believe the vaccine could be unsafe.Only 5% of those surveyed said they already had been inoculated, a figure that remained consistent across income groups.Of the rest, 52% said they did not plan to get vaccinated.Among the 40% who said they wanted the vaccine, 12% said they already had attempted to find it but failed.HIV vaccine feat leaves more questions than answers

</br>
Only hours after HIV vaccine researchers announced the achievement of a milestone that has eluded them for a quarter of a century, they began plotting their next steps and coming to grips with a sobering reality.Their ultimate goal, halting the spread of AIDS, remains far in the future.A Thai and American team had announced early Thursday in Bangkok that they had found a combination of vaccines that provided modest protection against infection with HIV, offering the first proof of principle that the deadly disease could be tamed by teaching the immune system to recognize the virus and defeat it.Scientists around the world hailed the achievement.Some in California's high risk groups may not get swine flu vaccine until 2010

If H1N1 flu vaccine shortages persist, California may not be able to vaccinate those most at risk by the end of December, public health officials said Thursday, amid furor over how the vaccine has been distributed so far."We believe by and large the vaccine is being given to those who should receive it," said Dr. Gil Chavez, an epidemiologist with the California Department of Public Health, but "we may not be able to meet the target if the vaccine...

Swine flu vaccination rates vary wildly from state to state
</br>
By Thomas H. Maugh II
</br>
Vaccination rates for the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus have varied widely around the country, with New England having the highest rates and the South having the lowest, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported this week.Rhode Island had the highest rate of vaccination for swine flu, with about 39% of its population immunized, while Mississippi had the lowest rate, with 13% receiving the shot, according to the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.Among children, Georgia had the lowest vaccination rate, at 21%.Georgia now has the highest level of ongoing swine flu activity of any state.FDA warns against using rotavirus vaccine
</br>
By Thomas H. Maugh II
</br>
The Food and Drug Administration on Monday warned doctors and parents against using the Rotarix rotavirus vaccine until further testing can confirm that it is safe.The warning follows an academic research group's discovery subsequently confirmed by the FDA and Rotarix manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline that the vaccine contains a pig virus called porcine circovirus 1, or PCV1.The virus is not known to cause illness in humans, and no adverse effects have been observed in children vaccinated with Rotarix, but the agency decided to err on the side of caution with the warning until more information can be obtained.Walter Plowright dies at 86; invented vaccine that eliminated serious cattle disease
</br>
By Thomas H. Maugh II
</br>
Dr. Walter Plowright, the British veterinarian often called one of the "heroes of the 20th century" because of the massive increase in meat and dairy products resulting from his invention of a vaccine that has almost totally eliminated the cattle disease rinderpest, died Feb. 19 in London.He was 86.Most Americans have probably never heard of rinderpest, a virus in the same family as measles that causes one of the most lethal diseases in cattle.It never established a foothold in the Americas and was eliminated from Europe early in the 20th century, but its introduction to Africa in 1889 in cattle shipped from India caused what some consider the most catastrophic natural disaster ever to affect that continent.Swine flu danger appears to be ebbing
</br>

</br>
The likelihood of a third wave of pandemic H1N1 influenza appears to be declining as all indicators of swine flu activity remain low throughout the bulk of the country, according to data released Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."Nobody can say for sure that we are totally out of the woods, but the further we go into spring and summer, the less likely we are to see another wave," said CDC spokesman Tom Skinner.It would not surprise the agency to see some local activity of the virus "continue to percolate along," he added.Scientists study use of tobacco plants in making flu vaccine
</br>
Here's an idea: Rehabilitate the tobacco plant by using it to make flu vaccine.This may sound like a double whammy nightmare for anyone who believes that vaccines are killing us all and GMOs are killing us all, but let's put that aside and examine what the scientists are doing, and why.First off, the rationale: Production of flu vaccine is rooted in old technology.You need fertile chicken eggs, millions of them, for growing the flu virus before you kill it and turn it into vaccine.'Vaccines court' rejects mercury autism link in 3 test cases
</br>
By Thomas H. Maugh II and Andrew Zajac
</br>
The federal "vaccines court" ruled Friday in three separate cases that the mercury containing preservative thimerosal does not cause autism, a finding that supports the broad scientific consensus on the matter but that greatly disappointed parents who are convinced that their child's illness was caused by vaccines.The court had ruled 13 months ago that a combination of the measles mumps rubella vaccine, commonly known as the MMR vaccine, and thimerosal does not cause the disorder, so the new ruling may finally close the bulk of litigation on the matter.H1N1 vaccine was unevenly distributed across L.A. County, figures show
</br>
By Molly Hennessy Fiske
</br>
Officials have distributed the H1N1 flu vaccine unevenly throughout Los Angeles County, with fewer doses going to medically underserved areas in the county's north and south, according to public health agency figures.While there is now a surplus of vaccine countywide, northern and southern areas received a smaller share of the roughly 3 million vaccine doses distributed by the county, mainly because they are home to fewer doctors, pharmacies and other health providers, experts said.We have learned a lot from the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.We have learned, for example, that one basic assumption about pandemics was wrong: You don't need a radical mutation in a flu virus to produce a pandemic.All you need is enough change within a surface protein for a new strain to blow past acquired immunity and blaze around the world, as this one did.And we've seen that not every pandemic strain is especially lethal.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta estimated that 11,690 Americans had died of swine flu by mid January.FDA creates partnership to boost regulatory science
</br>
The Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health on Wednesday announced a plan to help the FDA make swifter decisions about the safety and effectiveness of new products and procedures that flow from advanced research.The new partnership will promote the development of testing and other tools that FDA regulators need in order to assess drugs and other products coming from fields such as genomics, nanotechnology and stem cell therapy.Officials from both agencies said laboratory science leading to treatments had vastly outdistanced regulatory science, which develops the methods to evaluate the safety and quality of those treatments.Copyright 2010 Los Angeles Times
