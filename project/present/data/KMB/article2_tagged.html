This is the sixth and final installment in a multi part series that looks at various options used by income investors to boost their yield while waiting for dividend growth to lift their portfolio's overall yield on cost.Last week we looked at Master Limited Partnerships MLPs .This week we are looking at Yield does not come without a price.The five options looked at in prior weeks carry some form of added risk and/or complexity.Ultimately, dividend growth investors realize that long term and sustainable high yield investments are grown over time.This is accomplished by purchasing high quality dividend investments with a reasonable yield and a long history of growing their dividends, and waiting for the yield on cost to grow.&lt;&lt; Previous Page
