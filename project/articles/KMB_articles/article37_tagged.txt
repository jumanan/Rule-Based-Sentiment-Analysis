Mar.14 Economist Michael Cox has a slogan to suggest if you're trying to attract talented workers from either coast: Move here and get a free BMW.It's not false advertising, says the former chief economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, who's now at Southern Methodist University.Most professionals working in the Northeast and California pay the equivalent of a year's worth of expensive car payments in annual personal income tax which we don't have.But we don't need an ad campaign to encourage immigration to North Texas.Every year for the last three years, Dallas Fort Worth has added a Little Rock to our population, Cox says.Maintain that annual increase of 165,000 for three years, and we will have "annexed" a San Jose, Calif., since 2007."Every six years, we add a million people," says Cox, who heads the O'Neil Center for Global Markets and Freedom at SMU."That's unbelievable.When they lose their jobs in Cleveland, they say, 'OK, let's pack up and move to Dallas.' " 
If population trends continue, we'll replace Chicago as the third largest metropolitan area in 20 years, if not sooner, Cox says.Why here?Why now?"The world has fallen in our lap," he says."We're a service based economy.We're perfectly poised for growth domestically.Now we have global growth through technology that enables us to be the 'it' economy." 
Think of Texas as the target, attracting individuals and companies fleeing high taxes, faltering economies and sky high costs.For every dollar a person or company makes in most of the Northeast or California, the state grabs about 10 cents in taxes.Texas lets you keep the full dollar.Now think of Dallas Fort Worth as the bull's eye.More than any other Texas metro area, Dallas Fort Worth has tied its future to foreign economies with large populations, fast growing workforces and increasing wages.For decades, we've been telling ourselves how smart we are to live here.We have hot weather.But we also have air conditioning."You don't have to shovel heat," says John Holt, chief executive of Dallas based SWS Group's banking subsidiary, Southwest Securities FSB.Cox developed a following during his 25 years at the Dallas Fed.For 10 of those, he was the chief economist guiding the bank's policy with his economic analysis.With the help of others, Cox developed a critical index used by the entire Federal Reserve System.The "spaghetti index" tracks employment ups and downs in each of the 12 Fed districts."I would have preferred to have called it the Cox index, but others at the Fed thought it looked like a bowl of spaghetti," he says.Subscribe to Rate this Commentary
